OK, we are going to talk about you group design projects.

You should be about have halfway done with them, and I'd like to find out how like you **'re** doing. Let's start **at** the beginning.

So, what was your first step in the design process? Can anyone tell me?

Well, first, we need**ed** to product **to** design, and design problem, right?

Right. Somebody the client, wants something **designed** like a product,a service, or a system. So **then what?**

Well, then we had to analyze the contexts **of** the design problem. Specifically, we need to know who wants the product designed and why.

Em, that's the client, and em what **constraints**, what **limitations govern its** designs, and who will be using it, and for what.

Very good. And your projects, the client was just theoretical.

But I ask your to be realistic about what they might want and why. So who wants to go first and tell us about **their** project?

Well, **our group** chose a DVD player, our client was a electronics **manufacturer**, and they wanted a **certain** kind of DVD player to **complete** their product line. Like, they already **had** an home player and a car player, and **now** they want a portable player.

Good, so as you **read in** your textbooks, the idea for the new product **might** come form the client, but they might not be **entirely** sure about what they want or what's possible.

They may not able to tell you exactly what **components** to **use or** what techhnology is **available**.

So did you do some research? **I assume** you **found** out what technology was available and what's in demand.

Oh yeah, we also checked out similar products **on** the market to try to find out what their best and **worst features** were.

Good thinking. You don't want to repeat the mistakes that other people **have made**. OK, so then you have to identify **the constraints imposed on** the design project.

So, somebody from a different group, what **kinds** of constraints did you find.

Well, our group chose to design a car. So constraints included **safety considerations** and of course **cost** constraints.

We found out **that** the **sound** system we **wanted to install would have made the car** way too expensive, and of course we **had time constraints**, your deadline.

Funny, but you realize that there are dealines in business too, right?

Yes, yes we do. But we had another one **we didn't consider at** first. We had to make the car compatible with the exisiting products.

We found out that no one made tires in the size that we needed, so that was a constraint.

Our **car design required tires of a certain size range**. So we **modified** our design.

That's a very important point. There's no sense in trying to find parts for your product that don't exist.

Okay, then you had to **determine** the needs **of the** intened users **of the** product. Anyone?

Yeah, our group did some market research. We **gave a** survey to a focus group. The other students **from** this class. They were **our** intened users.

This way we found out what **features** they **wanted**, and **we** even **had them** rank **them**, so we **could** find out which one **were** most important. 

And, this is the key, because the answer will affect your design.

Yeah, everybody said they wanted the portable DVD player that was **lightweight**, durable, so **that it** would'nt break if they **dropped** it, indespensive and easy to carry and make it really durable was expensive.

So we have to find out if they wanted the more expensive **but** durable one, or the cheaper but **less durable** one, that really help us to decide **on a** the final design.

**Very** interesting,  **wich** should they choose?

They **chose** the cheaper, less durable one.

Well, **that's life** on **a** student budget. Okay, well it sounds like you're all on **your** way **with** your project.

I hope everyone will **them in** on time.

I'm sure **you're** enjoy the creative part, the idea **phase of** the project, or your brainstrom, come up with your design solution, and finnally, design **and** produce the **prototype**.

Now, of course, your prototypes will just be sketches or maybe models, but they'll still help you see that what you did, right?

And what you, well, what you could have done better, or just different way. Your don't know what you might learn from this step.

**总结**

The lecture discussed the problems and solutions encountered by student teams in designing assignments.

<summary>精听 2</summary>

Listen to part of the lecture in **an engineering** class.

Let's review the basics of what we **covered on** Friday. There're only **a** limited **supply of** resources like oil and **coal**, but will never run out of wind. 

It's abundant. And there're so much potential associated with this **resource**. It's an environmentlly friendly way to generate electricity.

So **harnessing** wind energy is **being touted** as a **direction we**need to be **heading in** to satisfied a future global **energy needs**.

At we looked in **depth** at the standard model for **harvesting** wind energy, **properller**, **wind turbines**. Here's the **drawing of a propeller, wind turbine** again.

Now, as I mentioned Friday, nearly all wind **farms use** this type of turbine.

You can't really miss that distinct **three propeller** desgin. But today, I want **to** present **an alternative**type, the vertical **axis**, wind **turbine**.

So, here‘s a vertical axis, wind turbine. Now, **if** you **'ve seen one propeller turbine, you've** basiclly seen them **all**.

**But with** vertical axis turbines, there is **such** huge variety in design. **And** I chose to start with this particular model for a reason.

**Crews will be installing** it in the ground near the architecture **hall**, **They'll be putting up** forty **of them at** **differing** heights starting today.

When they **'re all up,** the electricity **they** generate will power more than 50% of the **exterior site lights on our campus**.

Now, my engineer department **colleagues** and I found some members of the university **planning committee were opposed to the installation** idea, **at least initially**.

**One of their big** concerns **was** that it would negtively impact **the aesthetics** of the campus.

Howerer, once **this** particular model was **officially** persented, well, those members **quickly came** around **to share our point of view**.

And to me, this particular model **looks** more like moving **sculpture than an intrusive eyesore**. Its design **blends  well with the surrounding landscape and** architecture.

Some **other** model definitely **weren't** attractive.

Anyway, once they go up and you've seen them, **I'd** be **interested** to hear what you think.

But **this** wouldn't be the engineering department, if all we did was consider **the** aesthetics **of** technology.

So, both vertical axis and properller turbines will work fine with mid range **winds**.

But one **feature** that makes any **model** of the vertical **access** turbine **preferable to a propeler turbine** is **its ability to function in a** wide range of wind conditions.

**It** can generate electricity by efficiently capturing low speed winds,  **say a mere 12 miles per** hour.

And it also **operates well in turbulent gusty** winds. Storm force winds. **Propeller tubines** just can't **efficiently** handle winds **on theses two opposite ends of the spectrum.**

And you know, when we are considering a **residential or an** urban **setting**, Let's face it.

Space **is** usually at a **premium**, It's a valuable, **limited commodity**.

Unfortunatelly though, when you have a group of **porpeller turbines on a** wind **farm, they** undergo **a decrease in** power out**put**, **the closer they are placed to** one another.

So **they have** to be spread **out**. They **require** a substantial **amount of** space. Vertical axis turbines, howerver, can be placed in close **proximity to** one **ano**ther.

Consequently, you can reduce the **plot of land needed** it, and **fit** more **turbines on it**. **Ultimately, then** they **overcome the biggest constraint faced** by wind farm.

Now, there's a study, that, well, strangely enough, we're learning ways we **might** continue **to increase the efficiency of** turbine **by** observ**ing** schools of swimming fish.

See when a fish moves its tail back and forth to achive **forward propulsion**, it obviously move the water around it back and forth.

And this motion affects nearby fish. And we **'ve noticed that** fish arranged **themselves**, they space themselves in relationship to one another to take advantage **of** the back and forth motion of the water **caused** by other.

In other words, they arrange themselves to **strategic** configurations, which make them forward movement as **a group** most **efficient**.

Now the fish **study** has provided **insight** into how a vertical axis **turbine affects the air around it for** nearby turbines.

And an **implication** is it that could be a significant increase **in** efficiency if we change the way we set up wind farms.

**Now** currently, wind farms can **configured use to the all turbines** intro in a group **rotate** in the same direction.

But what if we set up a vertical **access** wind **turbines** in **alternating rows?**

I mean so that one row of turbines **spins in** one direction, and the next **row spins** in the opposite direcion, so clockwise and **then conterclockwise.** This idea **is now being tested in the field.**

**总结**

In this lecture, the professor introduced the advantages of vertical axis turbines.

**Dead Zones in the Sea**

Many cities depend on nearby rivers to carry away waste. It eventually reaches the sea, where it provides nutrients for plankton(small organisms that drift in water), causing plankton blooms(rapid and **excessive** increases in plankton populations). When plankton die and sink into deeper water, they **decompose** in a process that uses oxygen. As a result, the water beneath plankton blooms often becomes **anoxic** (lacking oxygen) and thus devoid of life. These"dead zones"now occur permanently or seasonally at over four hundred places worldwide, and one of the largest forms annually where the Mississippi River meets the sea. Dead zones form most **readily** where water is **stagnant** (moves little) and separated into nonmixing layers. Stagnant pools near the seabed eventually lose their oxygen as the sinking plankton build into piles. Despite their massive nutrient flows to the ocean, the Orinoco and Amazon Rivers have no dead zones, because water is pushed offshore too fast for oxygen to be lost Where the flows of once great rivers have been greatly reduced by **dams**, cities, and crops along their course, areas where rivers flow into seas may hold water long enough for dead zones to form. This is the case, sadly, for rivers like the Loire in France and Po in Italy, when their lack of oxygen **suppresses** life in thousands of square kilometers of seabed every summer.

Enclosed seas like the Baltic, Adriatic and Black also suffer problems of stagnation. Shaped like a deep bowl that is **cut off from** the Mediterranean by a shallow underwater **ridge** in the Bosporus Strait, the Black Sea was a freshwater lake when sea levels went down **fairly** dramatically during the last **glaciation** (an extremely cold period during which much of Earth's water was locked in **ice sheets**). It refilled eventually, with saltwater, in a catastrophic flood seven thousand years ago, when the Mediterranean rose high enough to break through the Bosporus. Massive **floods** triggered tremendous migration, and the event may be recorded in the ancient tale of Gilgamesh. Today only a warm, less salty, surface layer is well oxygenated and able to support abundant life. This low-density layer sits over the cooler, saltier waters of the deep basin like a **lid** and has **suffocated** life below. Deeper than about 150 meters, the Black Sea is devoid of oxygen.

The Black Sea owes its **stagnant** depths to nature, but other enclosed seas have us to blame. Northern Europe's Baltic Sea connects to the North Sea only by shallow, **tortuous** channel that **curls** around Denmark. The rivers that feed it drain from highly **populous** countries and run through croplands and intensive pig farms. They receive **substances** flowing out of heavy industry and **paper-pulp** mills and sewage from cities great and small. By the time the rivers reach the coast they are loaded with nutrients and organic waste. Sediment samples from one bay of the Baltic Sea tell a similar story to those from the Mississippi dead zone. Land was cleared and trees **felled** for agriculture and industry at increasing rates from 1800 **onward**, which led to an **ever-growing** rise in nutrient runoff. Problem from plankton blooms and **anoxic** bottom water emerged after the 1950s, when **artificial** fertilizers came into widespread use. The number of people in areas surrounding the Baltic Sea has more than doubled since then, and sewage has **compounded** the effects of fertilizers.

The Baltic is a huge **brackish** water lake that occasionally takes in saltwater from the **denser** North Sea. When conditions are right, the North Sea pours in over the underwater ridge around Denmark, staying close to the seabed as it moves. **Brackish** water ( mix of salt and freshwater)is less dense and thus flows out at the same time along the surface. This density difference restricts mixing between the salty deep and fresher surface layers and so promotes a loss of oxygen when dead plankton sink to the bottom of the sea. Species that need saltwater to thrive are thus confined to the deep layers with **dwindling** oxygen. One reason why Baltic **codfish** stocks fell so **catastrophically** in recent years was that their eggs could not survive in these deep pockets of low-oxygen saltwater.

**Dinosaurs and Parental Care**

From fossil evidence alone the question of whether or not dinosaurs cared for their young is very difficult to answer. Because behaviors are not preserved in the fossil record, we can only make inferences from indirect evidence. Parental care can be divided into two types of behavior: prehatching (building nests and incubating eggs-for example, sitting on top of them so as to warm the eggs and encourage hatching) and posthatching(feeding the young and guarding the nests). Most of our evidence comes from **alleged** dinosaur **rookeries** (places where nests are built). Several have been excavated in eastern Montana, where a large concentration of dinosaur nests was found at a place now called Egg Mountain. Most of these probably belonged to the **hadrosaur Maiasaura**. Preserved in these nests are the bones of baby dinosaurs. The finds at Egg Mountain and other sites around the world document that dinosaurs laid their eggs in nests.

The nests at Egg Mountain are reported to be **equally spaced**, separated by a space corresponding to the length of an adult Maiasaura. From this **arrangement** scientists have inferred that the nests were separated in this way to allow incubation in a tightly packed nesting **colony**. Although this interpretation is open to challenge, the discovery of **Oviraptor** adults on top of **Oviraptor** egg clutches(as determined by embryos in some eggs) is relatively powerful evidence that at least this dinosaur incubated its nests.

Evidence for parental care following hatching is much more **controversial** Behavioral speculation based on indirect fossil evidence is dangerous because the data is not always as **unambiguous** as might appear. At Egg Mountain, many nests contain baby dinosaur bones. Not all the dinosaurs in the nest are the same size. Many of the small bones found in the nests are associated with **jaws** and teeth, teeth that show signs of wear. It seems reasonable to assume that the wear was caused by the chewing of the coarse plants that were the hatchlings' diet. Because the young were still in the nest this food may have been brought to the **rookery **by foraging adults. This line of **reasoning** suggests that these animals had an advanced system of parental care. A closer look at the evidence **clouds** this interpretation. Analysis of dinosaur embryos indicates that **worn** surfaces are present on the teeth of juveniles even before hatching. Just as a human baby moves inside the mother before birth, modern-day archosaurs also **grind** their teeth before birth, wearing the surface in some spots. Thus, the fossil evidence for an advanced parental care system in **extinct** dinosaurs is suggestive but **inconclusive**, and it is hard even to imagine the sort of **paleontologic** discovery that could settle this debate for good.

The strongest evidence that extinct dinosaurs had some form of advanced parental care system is based on an understanding of the **phylogenetic** relationships among dinosaurs and their closest living relatives. Birds(which are **in essence** modern, **feathered** dinosaurs), even **primitive** ones such as **ostriches** and **kiwis**, **exhibit** parental care, so some form of parental care can be inferred to have existed in the last common ancestor of all birds. Although **unappreciated**, **crocodiles** are **reptiles** that are also caring parents. They build nests, guard the nests, and in some cases dig their young out of the nest when they hear the **chirping** young ones hatching. The young even communicate with each other while still in the egg by high-frequency **squeaks** (as birds do). Some evidence suggests that this squeaking is a cue for the synchronization of the hatching. Since birds and **crocodiles** share a common ancestor, the simplest explanation for the characteristics they share (such as nest building and some form of parental care) is that they evolved only once-that these **attributes** were present in their common ancestor and passed on to its descendants. Because extinct dinosaurs also **descended** from that ancestor, the simplest and most general theory is that extinct dinosaurs also shared these characteristics, even though they cannot be directly observed, and we cannot be sure how elaborate their parental care was.

**Han Dynasty Tomb Sculpture**

Stone sculpture was something of a latecomer to Chinese art, starting a thousand years after **figures** were being made in **jade** and bronze Under the first period of the Han dynasty, known as the Western Han (206 B.C.E. 9 C.E.), it was used mainly for the tombs (burial chambers) of emperors or local rulers, but by the Eastern Han(25 C.E. -220 C.E.), the second period of Han rule, it had spread more widely. This change was largely the result of the increased importance of the tomb in the political philosophy of the time. The early Western Han emperors, faced with the problem of **forging** a unified empire threatened by **uprisings** on the part of ambitious rival kingdoms. had retained many of the first emperor's policies based on military force and **harsh** laws. But by the middle of the first century B.C.E., these were being replaced by an adaptation of the ideas of the fifth-century B.C.E. philosopher, Confucius, whose philosophy emphasized personal and governmental morality, to the conditions of a united empire. Believing that in the long run, stability depended on an acceptance of the legitimacy of the ruler(and dynasty) rather than on military force, Han intellectuals and officials adopted a moral philosophy based on the belief that humans are perfectible through education, and that a hierarchical society consists of a network of **reciprocal** duties and obligations: the **subject**'s duty to obey the ruler was matched by the ruler's obligation to care for his subjects.

The increased emphasis on civic duty and **order** encouraged stability, loyalty, and obedience to the state, reinforcing central power. At the same time, the insistence on the value of education attracted intellectuals into state service, providing a well-qualified administration. In an age of rising standards of living with the growth of upwardly mobile merchant and artisan classes, the importance of **filial piety** (respect for parents and ancestors), one of the greatest of Confucian virtues, led to competitive tomb building. The imperial **mausoleums**(aboveground, **freestanding** tombs constructed as memorials)set the example and their **extravagance** was copied downwards. But why was there such urgent building of mausoleums?

A change in ritual had increased both the importance of the tomb and the scope for display. The ancestral rites previously held in city or palace temples were transferred to the tomb itself, making it necessary to build a hall south of the grave **mound** where the sacrifices could be performed. To emphasize the importance of the site, the **approach** was lined with an avenue of stone monuments known as the “spirit road" since it was along this road that the **deceased** would travel to the grave. This innovation became popular in Han society. It spread from the emperor to other parts of Han society, eventually crossing into neighboring lands such as Korea and Vietnam. The result was a **manifold** expansion in the use of stone **statuary**. No longer the **prerogative** of a few, it was now open to citizens anxious to display their **piety** and wealth by erecting freestanding stone statues on their fathers' graves. The use of **statuary** spread so rapidly that, in order to prevent a complete devaluation of its status, it was controlled by imperial decree, and henceforth the number and **subject matter** of spirit road statues were regulated according to the social rank of the **deceased**.

More tomb statuary has survived than any other form of Han statuary, and the easiest way to see the development of sculpture during the first and second centuries is to use the tomb as a starting place. During the first century C.E. there **appears** to have been a remarkable increase in the use of stone in connection with the tomb. While free-standing statues and monuments were placed on the tomb above ground, the interior of stone and **brick** tomb chambers below were adorned with carvings of figures on walls and engravings on walls and doors. Features previously made in wood, such as **coffins** and **steles** (vertical markers placed in the ground to memorialize the dead), were now carved in stone. Above and below ground, tomb layout and ornamentation followed a coordinated plan. The same images and themes reappear in different places, and the tasks of the tomb are clearly allocated between different media. The result is an **unparalleled** picture of contemporary life and thought.

**Why Water Bugs Practice Paternal Care of Eggs**

Although paternal care of young (fathers caring for their young) is common among fishes, the trait is rare among other animals, vertebrates and invertebrates alike. Among the few paternal insects are the giant water **bugs**. In **Lethocerus** water bugs, males guard and moisten clutches of eggs(eggs deposited during a single **episode** of laying) that females glue onto the stems of aquatic vegetation located above the waterline. Other kinds of male water bugs(e.g., Abedus and Belostoma)permit their **mates** to lay eggs directly on their backs, after which the male **assumes** responsibility for their welfare. A male Abedus caring for its eggs spends hours **perched** near the water's surface, **pumping** his body up and down to keep well-**aerated** water moving over the eggs. Clutches of Abedus eggs that are experimentally separated from a male attendant do not develop, demonstrating that male parental care is essential for offspring survival in this case. 

Bob Smith has explored both the history and the adaptive value of these unusual paternal behaviors. Since the closest relatives of the family that contains the **paternal** water bugs are the **Nepidae**, a family of insects without male parental care, we can be confident that the **brooding** species(species caring for eggs) evolved from **nonpaternal** ancestors. Whether out-of-water brooding and back brooding evolved **independently**, or whether one **preceded** the other, is not known, although some evidence suggests that back brooding came later. In **particular,** female **Lethocerus** sometimes lay their eggs on the backs of other individuals, male or female, when they cannot find suitable vegetation for that purpose. This unusual behavior indicates how the transition from out-of-water **brooding** to back **brooding** might have occurred. Females with the tendency to lay their eggs on the backs of their mates could have reproduced in temporary **ponds** and pools where aquatic vegetation **sticking** out of the water was scarce or absent.

But why do the eggs of water bugs require **brooding**? Huge numbers of aquatic insects lay eggs that do perfectly well without a **caretaker** of **either** sex. However, Smith notes that the eggs of **giant** water bugs are much larger than the standard aquatic insect egg, with **correspondingly** large requirement for oxygen, which is needed to sustain the high metabolic rates underlying embryonic development. But the relatively low **surface-to-volume** ratio of large aquatic egg leads to an oxygen **deficit** inside the egg. Since oxygen diffuses through air much more easily than through water, laying eggs out of water can solve that problem. But this solution creates another problem, which is the risk of drying out that the eggs face when they are **high and dry**. The solution, **brooding** by males that moisten the eggs repeatedly, **sets the stage for** the evolutionary transition to back brooding at the air-water **interface**.

Wouldn't things be simpler if water bugs providing parental care simply laid small eggs with large surface-to-volume ratios? To explain why some water bugs produce eggs so large that they need to be brooded, Smith points out that water bugs are among the world's largest insects almost certainly because they specialize in **grasping** and **stabbing** large vertebrates, including fish, frogs, and tadpoles. Water bugs, like all other insects, grow in size only during the immature stages. After the final **molt** (loss of outer covering layer) to adulthood, no additional growth occurs. As an immature insect loses its outer covering as it grows from one stage to the next, it acquires a new flexible outer covering that permits an expansion of size, but no immature insect grows more than 50 or 60 percent per molt. One way for an insect to grow large, therefore, would be to increase the number of molts before making the final transition to adulthood. However, no giant water bug molts more than six times. This **observation suggests** that these insects are locked into a five-or six-molt sequence, just as the bird species the **spotted sandpiper** evidently cannot lay more than four eggs per clutch. If a water bug **is to** grow large enough to kill a frog in just five or six molts, then the immature insect that hatches from the egg must be large, because it will get to **undergo** only five or so 50-percent expansions.

**Imitation in Monkeys and Apes**

Almost all animals learn novel tasks more easily if they can observe a **knowledgeable demonstrator**. Biologist Tom Langen trained individual **magpie jays** to **pry** open a door on box that contained food. Subsequently, birds whose social groups included a demonstrator learned how to open doors much more rapidly than birds whose groups did not. Indeed, birds in groups that lacked a demonstrator did not even realize that there was food in the boxes. Similarly, **in captivity**, many monkeys can learn to use **rudimentary** tools to obtain food, and they do so more quickly and accurately in the presence of a demonstrator. If monkeys learned like humans do. it would be safe to assume that the monkeys learn to perform the tasks by watching the demonstrator and imitating his actions. This would imply that the monkeys understand the demonstrator's intentions and goals. But this does not seem to **be the case**.

Most animal species show very little evidence of **purposeful** copying by imitation. In the laboratory, monkeys are attracted to tools and often begin experimenting with them after observing another monkey do so, suggesting that social **companions** enhance and **facilitate** tool use. But learning about a tool's use through"social **facilitation**" typically requires extensive practice through **trial and error**. As a result, different individuals **adopt** different **idiosyncratic** styles, and the spread of the skill is very slow. Although many monkey species can learn to use tools in captivity, there are very few examples of tool use in the wild. **Capuchin** monkeys, which inhabit Central and South America, are the only monkeys that regularly use sticks or stones to **pry** into trees or break open nuts under natural conditions. Capuchin also have comparatively large brains compared to other monkeys. The **relative** lack of **spontaneous** tool use in monkey species **suggests** that monkeys have difficulty recognizing the relation between actions and objects.

In the wild, baboon monkeys seem to use tools only in aggressive **contexts**. When **displaying**, male baboons occasionally **wave** or throw sticks in the direction of their rivals. Whether they recognize the **potential** function of these weapons, though, seems doubtful. When one group of baboons in Namibia **dislodged** stones from a **cliff** when they were disturbed by humans, they did so not only when people were under the cliff but also when they were too far away to be **struck**. At Gombe, where chimpanzees compete with baboons for food, chimpanzees throw branches at baboons. Baboons however, never throw objects at chimpanzees.

Chimpanzees and **orangutans** are different. In captivity these animals, which are apes rather than monkeys, **attend** closely to a demonstrator when learning to use tools to open boxes, and they require very few **trials** to learn to copy his actions. They seem to recognize the intentions and goals of the demonstrator, and they rapidly learn a tool's function from **attending to** his behavior. Although they do not copy the demonstrator's exact **motor patterns** as closely as children do, they do tend to **conform** to his technique.

Under natural conditions, chimpanzees and orangutans also use a variety of tools for different purposes. In fact, different populations of chimpanzees and orangutans use different kinds of tools for different purposes, and the use of specific tool types appears to be socially transmitted. Two points about tool use in chimpanzees and orangutans seem relevant. First, in **marked** contrast to monkeys, no **population** of chimpanzees has been reported not to use tools. Second, unlike monkeys, chimpanzees and orangutans often show foresight and planning in selecting and modifying tools in advance of their use. Before fishing for termites, chimpanzees often search **some distance** from the termite **mound** to find an appropriate **prodding** stick and **strip** the **bark** from it. Similarly, when preparing to **crack open** nuts, chimpanzees must carry both stones and nuts to suitable hard surfaces. Often, this means that a chimpanzee will carry both nuts and stones over **considerable** distances before beginning a nut-cracking **session**.

In their ability to plan, understand a tool's function, and appreciate a demonstrator's goals, then, apes are **strikingly** different from most monkeys. This is not to say, however, that tool use and manufacture are unique to apes, or that monkeys are completely incapable of imitation.

**Iron in Ancient Africa**

Metal-production technologies (metallurgy) have had a profound influence on the course of human history. Aside from gold, used for jewelry and ornamentation, the first metal to be widely used was copper, with smelting(the process of extracting metal from ore by heating) beginning by 5000 B.C.E. in modern-day Serbia. Production of bronze from copper and tin began by 2800 B.C.E. in Anatolia, in what is modern-day Turkey. Next was iron, with smelting starting around 1500 B.C.E. in Anatolia and spreading to Europe by 1100 B.C.E. Although iron production was difficult and complex, this metal's greater hardness made tools and weapons far superior to those made from copper and bronze.

For a long time, scholars believed that iron production came to sub-Saharan Africa from Anatolia. One reason for this is that iron smelting requires considerable knowledge and experience, yet there was no evidence for previous metals technology in Africa. In particular, there seemed to have been no copper metallurgy, a likely precursor to iron production. Since Anatolia did possess the necessary knowledge and skill, it seemed to be a plausible source.

Some of the first evidence for African iron production was found in Meroe and dated to around 500 B.C.E.: iron tools and weapons, the remains of **furnaces**, and a large number of **heaps of slag**(waste left behind after processing metallic ores). This was significant, because the kingdom of Meroe had close contact with Egypt to the north, where iron production had been imported from Anatolia and was known by 670 B.C.E. Therefore, it seemed logical that iron technology had diffused southward **through Egypt** to Meroe, and from Meroe to **sub-Saharan** Africa.Some archaeologists have proposed a different source: Carthage, a north African city on the Mediterranean coast founded around 800 B.C.E. by the Phoenicians, whose homeland was close to Anatolia. However, no direct archaeological evidence for iron smelting has been found in Carthage, and it is not easy to explain how such knowledge and skill could have crossed the Sahara desert to reach the sub-Saharan regions. Also **it appears that** the earliest iron production south of the desert **predates** Carthage's founding.

Although it seems clear that iron technology reached Meroe from Anatolia via Egypt, recent research shows that the rest of Africa developed the technology independently. There is evidence of iron working as early as 1000 B.C.E. in Central Africa, and iron **smelters** were in use in the Great Lakes region of East Africa around 900 B.C., both earlier than would have been possible if the technologies had diffused from Anatolia **through** Egypt. Iron production was widespread in West and East Africa **as early as** 600 B.C.E., and it reached southern Africa a few hundred years later. Not only do such dates precede those of Meroe's iron production, but the design of the **smelters** differs significantly from that of the **smelters** at Merod. Also, there are recent **indications** that sub-Saharan Africa had copper technology in place as early as 2200. C.E., long before iron production began. Aside from the knowledge gained from copper technology, some experience may have come from pottery production, since around 4000 B.C.E. crushed iron ore was used to coat pottery in Egypt, and the temperatures necessary for this were almost as high as those needed for iron smelting.

Diffusion of iron technology through Africa was relatively slow, possibly as a result of the scarcity of iron ore. It also did not have the immediate impact of other technologies (such as steam power in the modem era), but iron tools made hunting easier and facilitated tasks such as shaping wood, building houses, and digging **wells**. Iron technology certainly helped farmers and **so** accelerated the spread of agricultural communities in West Africa after 400 B.C.E., such as those of the upper Niger River, where farming **settlements** began to form clusters of villages that specialized in rice, cotton, or dried fish, and eventually developed into large market towns. However, the rarity of major iron deposits meant that iron tools, weapons, and other goods had to be transported over long distances Along with the difficulty of iron production, this probably gave iron workers an honored place in the community.

**According to paragraph 3. the fact that some of the first evidence of African iron production was found in Meroe led scholars to conclude that**

A. iron production must have started around 500 B.C.E., the approximate date of the founding of Meroe

B. Egypt had been importing iron tools and weapons from Meroe

C. the large number of slag heaps and furnaces found in the area were brought there from Anatolia

D. knowledge of iron production technology had spread throughout Africa from Egypt

选了C是因为看不懂slag，然后through、from和原文不一样，原文的through Egypt让我误解了，排除选了C，但是那段通篇都在讲知识传播，就算没理解也应该选D。

**Paragraph 3 suggests that some archaeologists proposed that Carthage was the place where African iron technology originated because**

A. the Phoenicians, who founded Carthage could have learned iron production technology from their neighbors in Anatolia

B. iron smelting was known to have existed in Carthage since at least 800 B.C.E

C. Archaeological evidence suggests that the most likely path of iron production into sub-Saharan Africa was through the central Sahara

D. while there is no evidence of contact between Meroe and Anatolia, there is evidence of contact between Meroe and Carthage

选了C是因为排除了B、D，选项A写的是neighbors而不是close to，选项C感觉原文出现了，排除选了C。

**Hence, many scholars no longer accept this hypothesis.**
我以为不接受上一个假说，引出下一个假说，但是第二个假说有明确反驳，应该接第二个假说。

**Based on evidence of copper technology and the dating of iron artifacts and furnaces in Central, East,and West Africa, it is clear that most of Africa developed iron technology independently.**

我以为这个只是假说不是确定的。

**According to the latest evidence, metal production in sub-Saharan Africa probably included copper smelting by 5000 B.C.E., bronze production by 2800 B.C.E., and iron smelting by 1500 B.C.E.**

这个乍一看全对的，地点错了不是撒哈拉，copper, with smelting(the process of extracting metal from ore by heating) beginning by 5000 B.C.E. **in modern-day Serbia.**

**Vasari. Art, and the Renaissance**

The Italian artist, architect, and author Giorgio Vasari was an important **influence** on the modem Western conception of art. In his ***Lives of the Most Eminent Painters***. ***Sculptors and Architects***, a series of biographies of artists published in 1550, Vasari coins a word to describe the art made by the genius Michelangelo Buonarotti (1475-1564) and other painters, sculptors, and architects only slightly less talented than **Buonarotti : Renaissance (rinascita, or "rebirth," in Italian)**. Although the artists Vasari discussed ***were not the first to*** take great interest in the art of ancient ***Greece and Rome-writers*** and thinkers of the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries such as Petrareh (1304-1374) and orenzo Valla (1407-1457) had already seen themselves as **reinvigorators** of the Greck and Roman past-Vasari thought the **rebirth** of the late fifteenth century **had gone beyond** the original. In Vasari's eyes, Buonarotti and his **contemporaries** were not simply skilled and highly trained artisans, but "rare men of genius"who should sign their name to and **take full credit** for their work. (Traditionally, artists did not sign their name to art works.) *This **notion** of the artist as creative genius did not apply to all branches of art, but to those in Vasari's **title**——painting, sculpture, and architecture——which were subsequently judged to be the major arts. Other types of art, such as **needlework** porcelain manufacture. goldsmithing and furniture making, were **minor** arts. decorative arts, or crafts and the names of those who made them were not considered important.*

Along with inventing the term "Renaissance" Vasari influenced how Westerners understand other aspects of art and culture. He is often **regarded as** the first art historian, *and his categories continue to shape the way that art history is taught and museums are arranged. Vasari's term"Renaissance"came to be used for a whole era and not simply its art. Because it derived from broad cultural changes and not specific events,* the Renaissance happened at different times in different parts of Europe. "Renaissance" is used to describe fifteenth-century Italian paintings, sixteenth-century English literature, and seventeenth-century **Scandinavian** architecture. Some scholars see the Renaissance as the beginning of the modern era, while others see it as a sort of a transition between medieval and modem.

Vasari's distinction between art(works made by "rare men of genius") and craft(works made by everyone else) has been extended to other cultural realms in Europe: certain forms of writing, such as poetry, history, and epics, came to be defined as literature, while other types of writing, such as letters and **diaries**, were excluded from this category; certain forms of music became classical, while everything else was popular or folk: ***instruction** that occurred in **institutional settings** was education, while that going on in the family or workshop was training or tradition. Scholars traced a growing **split** between professional and amateur, and, **to a lesser degree**, between learned and popular culture.*
 
Research into all aspects of cultural life over the last several decades, however, has pointed out that the divisions between *art and craft and learned and popular* are more **pronounced** in **hindsight** than they were at the time. *Vasari may have prized painting. sculpture, and architecture but **patrons*** carefully ordered and *paid enormous amounts for* **candlesticks**, silver and gold tableware **enamel** or jewel- **encrusted** dishes, embroidery (cloth with decorative **needlework**), and enormous **tapestries**, along with paintings and statues. Embroiderers as well as painters **experimented** with **perspective** *(the **representation** of three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional **plane**: paid great attention to proportion. shadowing, and naturalistic **representation**: and took their **subjects** from Greek and Roman antiquity. Writers paid as much, or even more, attention to literary **conventions** (**standard practices**) in their letters than in their poetry or drama. Folktales told orally for centuries became part of literary works in many countries, and people telling stories increasingly **included** those that someone had read in a book. Highly learned individuals participated in festivities involving all kinds of people that **poked fun at** their own intellectual **pretensions** and **satirized** various forms of power and status. Educated individuals did form a community among themselves with concerns different from the vast majority of the population, but they also shared many values and traditions with their neighbors who lacked extensive formal education.*

**Why does the author mention "writers and thinkers of the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries such as Petrareh (1304-1374) and orenzo Valla (1407-1457)" ?**

A. To identify writers and thinkers who had the greatest influence on Renaissance painting, sculpture, and architecture

B. To show that Vasari excluded some influential thinkers and writers from his biographies

C. To indicate that some writers and thinkers were inspired by ancient Greece and Rome before those discussed by Vasari

D. To **make the case** that the Renaissance had actually begun prior to the fifteenth century

排除A、B，C的结构没看懂，D以为make the case是举例，然后觉得说15世纪的复兴超过了最初的复兴，所以前面就已经有复兴，选了D。

**According to paragraph 1, which of the following best describes Giorgio Vasari's attitude toward art?**

A. Vasari believed that all types of artists should take credit for their work

B. Vasari valued painting, sculpture, and architecture more highly than other types of art

C. Vasari believed that there should be no distinction between major and minor arts.

D. Vasari valued the art of Greece and Rome more highly than the art of Buonarotti and his contemporaries.

这边文章说到底就没看懂，我是把所有都排除了，精读完知道选B。

**There are a number of reasons to believe that this was *indeed the case*.**

没看懂indeed the case是确实如此的意思，我以为是举例，然后这一整段都看得云里雾里的。


**It is now understood that both the major and minor arts drew inspiration from the same subjects, showed formal and stylistic complexity, and were purchased for high sums.**

purchased for high sums，没看懂，我还以为买大量的。the same subjects，我感觉没有读到，排除了。精读完依旧觉得这一点很暧昧，能够明白是透视法那边刺绣和绘画都学了并且运用，但是考试的时候不一定来得及总结。

**Clutch Size in Birds**

Each year the emperor penguin lays one egg, the pigeon lays one or two eggs, the **gull** typically lays three eggs, the Canada goose four to six eggs, and the American **merganser** ten or eleven eggs. What determines **clutch size** in birds? The **ultimate factors** that determine clutch size are the requirements for long-term (evolutionary) survival. Clutch size is viewed as an adaptation under the control of natural selection.

Natural selection will favor those birds that leave the most descendants to future generations. At first thought we might hypothesize that natural selection favors a clutch size that is the physiological maximum the bird can lay. We can test this hypothesis by taking eggs from nests as they are laid. When we do this, we find that some birds, such as the common pigeon, are determinate layers; they lay a given number of eggs, no matter what. The pigeon lays two eggs, if you take away the first, it will incubate the second egg only. If you add a third egg, it will incubate all three. But many other birds are indeterminate layers; they will continue to lay eggs until the nest is "full." If eggs are removed once they are laid, these birds will continue laying. When this **subterfuge** was used on a **mallard** female, she continued to lay one egg per day until she had laid 100 of them. Evidence from other, similar experiments suggests that most birds under normal circumstances do not lay their physiological limit of eggs but that **ovulation** is stopped long before this limit is reached.

The British **ornithologist** David Lack was one of the first ecologists to recognize the importance of evolutionary thinking in understanding adaptations in life history traits. In 1947 Lack **put forward** the idea that clutch size in birds was determined by the number of young that parents can provide with food. If his hypothesis is correct, the total production of young ought to be highest at the normal clutch size. And if one experimentally increased clutch size by adding eggs to nests, increased clutches should suffer greater losses because the parents could not feed the extra young in the nest.

One way to think about this problem of optimum clutch size is to use a simple economic approach. Everything an organism does has some costs and some benefits. The benefits of laying more eggs are very clear--more descendants in the next generation. The costs are less clear. There is an energy cost to make each additional egg, and there is a further cost to feed each additional nestling If the adult birds must work harder to feed their young, there is also a potential cost in adult survival -the adults may not live until the next breeding season. If adults are unable to work harder, there is a risk of reduction in offspring quality. Models of this type are useful because they help us think about the costs and benefits for a particular ecological strategy. No organism has an infinite amount of energy to spend on its activities. The reproductive rate of birds can be viewed as one **sector** of a bird's energy balance, and the needs of reproduction must be maximized within the **constraints** of other energy requirements. The total requirements involve metabolic maintenance, growth, energy used for predator avoidance, competitive interactions, and reproduction. According to Lack's hypothesis, if enough additional eggs are placed in a bird's nest, reproductive energy requirements **escalate** and the whole **brood** will suffer from starvation so that, in fact, fewer young birds will **fledge** from nests containing large numbers of eggs.

In England, the blue tit normally lays a clutch of nine to eleven eggs. What would happen if blue tits had a brood of twelve or thirteen? A researcher artificially manipulated broods at hatching by adding or subtracting chicks and found that the survival of the young blue tits in manipulated broods was poor. Blue tits **feed on** insects and apparently cannot feed additional young adequately, so more of the young starve. Consequently, it would not benefit a blue tit in the **evolutionary sense** to lay more eggs and the results are consistent with Lack's hypothesis. Individual birds **appear to** produce the clutch size that maximizes their reproductive potential.

**The Palaces of Minoan Crete**

The palaces built by the Minoan people of Crete (an island in the eastern **Mediterranean**) between 1950 B.C. and 1450 B.C. were centers of power, both **sacred** and **secular**, with wealth based on the stores of agricultural produce from the fertile **hinterland** that they controlled. What happened within them? Presumably they were busy places. The **receipt**, recording, and storage of goods brought in from the surrounding countryside must have been a major job, particularly at those **turns of the year** when the corn was harvested, **the olive ripe**, or the wine newly made. Administration of the goods and commodities leaving the storerooms for **consumption** in the palace, for use in the workshops, or for wider distribution must have taken place throughout the year. We may imagine the storage areas as busy by day, and probably carefully guarded at night.

The craft workers creating precious works in such materials as gold, Ivory, and **semiprecious** stones may well have been fulltime craft specialists, totally dependent on the palaces and working constantly within them, their products in demand both for immediate use and possibly for exchange quite **far afield**. Their raw materials were part of **palatial** wealth, and must have been kept under strict control. Similarly bronze workers, whose raw material would have been carefully recorded, no doubt worked close by. Pottery workshops seem to have been **further afield**, situated near the clay beds and fuel for the kilns (pottery ovens) rather than within palace **confines**, though their products could still have been largely or totally under palace control. The production of textiles was probably always an important palace-based activity, though we do not know in which rooms, **precisely**, spinning and weaving took place.

Some **revisionist** interpretations of the palace of **Knossos** have questioned whether people lived within it to any **great extent**. We must **face squarely** the fact, **implicit** in the above **account**, that **unequivocal** evidence for human residence **as opposed to** human use, is hard to find. Nonetheless, it seems overwhelmingly probable that all the palaces were lived in by some, if not all, of the people **engaged in** the many activities for which they show evidence. Many nonspecific rooms could have been lived in by various **dependents**--craft workers, guards, textile workers, servants, or slaves. This **remains** true even if we follow those **interpretations** that would prefer "temple" to "palace" as the buildings' prime **identification**.

In fact, the choice of "temple" rather than "palace" is a change of emphasis rather than a change of interpretation. From the early twentieth-century work of archaeologist Arthur Evans **onwards**, the **ingrained** and **embedded religious nature** of the palaces has been accepted, as has the fact that "palace" is **inadequate shorthand** for the buildings' **complexities**. There are, though, good reasons not to change **wholesale** to "temple" which in truth is similarly inadequate. The most obvious problem with such a change is the fact that, while a society based on large palaces with no temples has always been recognized as **anomalous** in the ancient world, large-scale temples with no palaces would **be equally so**. Unless there is a truly **huge gap** in our excavated evidence-possible, but as time goes on increasingly **unlikely**--these complex buildings are all we have. The most logical conclusion remains that they fulfilled two sets of functions **simultaneously**. Accurate **terminology** that did not **privilege** one function over another would require the **coinage** of a **portmanteau** term such as "palace-temple" or "temple-palace," but this seems an **undesirable** deviation from terminology that is long **established**, whatever its shortcomings.

What, though, of the ruling elite, whether **priests**, kings, or both? Is there evidence that the palaces housed a royal family? The **attempt** to see royal apartments throws into high relief not only the difficulty of identifying precisely the function of a room from its form, but also the fact that we do not really know who, in Minoan society, held the **reins** of power. The Minoan tradition indicates a king- yet power may have been wielded by a priest, or by a priest-king, combining functions that we would divide into sacred and secular. **Nonetheless**, it still seems overwhelmingly likely that the ruling elite lived in the palaces, or perhaps in both the palaces and the important houses in their immediate **vicinity**.

**Channel Conflict**

Manufacturers that create products often rely on other businesses or stores to sell those products to consumers These stores are the channel through which the products reach consumers. Sometimes a disagreement arises between the manufacturer and a store. This is called a channel conflict. Such disputes commonly occur because the manufacturer and the store selling the products may have different goals or **priorities**. In order to resolve the conflict, the manufacturer and store may need to negotiate and reach an agreement over how their opposing needs can be met.

Now listen to part of a lecture in **a** business class. 

OK, so, let's look at an example. There's a company that make**s** candy bars and other suger **sweets**, and it **distribute** these candys to grocery stores. Now, one of the grocery store **it distributes to**, well actually a major grocery store, a chain of stores, was putting this candy in a back coner of stores. And, though, some shoppers went to this back corner store, not every shoppers did. Lots of people would come in to pick up just **a few items**. Now, the reason of the store was putting the candy in the back corner was because the store wanted to promote healthier foods and a health image for the chain of stores. So, they were deliberately placing the candy in the less visible location. But the candy company was quite unhappy about this. Since the company thought people will buy more of this candy bar and sweets, and they will place at the front of the stores, **near the** cash **registers**, **where** people would see them when they were checking out. So what happend? Well, the candy company complained about the place **of their candy**, and **ever so meetings** between the candy company and the grocery store executives, the store agree to put the candy in the middle isle of the store, so that it would be more visible, not queit **as** visible as it would be at front by the cash registers, but still more visible than in the back corner. Basically they reached **a** compromise, so that candy company was satisfied and thought people would be able better see the candy and buy, and the grocery store could still promote **its** health image.

**Garden tours**

The university recently announced that the campus botanical garden which houses many beautiful and rare plant species, received funding from a generous donor. I think a great way to use this money would be to hire students who are studying botany to lead guided tours of the garden Although the garden is open to the public, no tours are currently offered. Tour guides could help visitors develop a deeper understanding of these rare and exotic plants so that they would have a more enjoyable experience at the garden. Also, by serving as guides botany students could benefit educationally, since it would give them a chance to share and reinforce what they learn in classes.  
  
Sincerely, Natalie Greine

Now, listen to two student discussig the letter. James, you're **studying botany**, right?

Oh yeah, I saw that, nice idea, but……

You don't sound you want to apply.

Well, it's just, I mean, we study a lot of advanced topics in our classes, right? **Stuff** like the **cell structure** and chemistry of plants. But, I think the information we’d be providing for this would be really basic and geared toward people who don't know much. And, we probably be saying same thing to every group. umm, yeah, you probably be memorizing a script. Right, just repeating a simple explanation every time. So, yeah, what you guys really be getting out of it? But, what about the visitors? What about them? I mean, what she says here, a deeper understanding. Well honestly, I think a lot of people, probably most people, just wanna walk around **or** sit and enjoy the pretty flowers, that's the main reason why they go. The peace **in** quiet.

Listen to part of a lecture from a biology class. 
So, in recent years, because of human activities and industry which often involve **burning fuels** to operate factories,cars, and so on, the **amount** of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased. It's a by-product of these activities. And, this increasing hard dioxide has an impact on the natural environment. In fact it's affecting insects in an **indirect** way. **How so?** Well in such rely on plants for food, and plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. But as the **amount** of carbon dioxide increases, it changes how plants grow. And that indirectly affects insects since they need the plants. So one indirect effect on insects is that they have difficulty getting enough nutrition from plants. Increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes these plants to grow larger. But as they grow larger, then nutrients they contain become more spread out or **diluted** to other big plant. And for insects that feed on plants, this means that the amount of nutrition they can get from each **bite** of the plant is reduced. So for example, leaf eating insects, like caterpillars, now need to larger number of leaves of a plant than they would have in the past, in order to get enough nutrition. And then it's also more difficult for insects to **digest** the plants they eat. Why? Well, as plants absorb more and more carbon dioxide, the chemical **composition** of the plants changes The extra carbon dioxide produces certain chemical **compounds** in the plant. It makes issues difficult for insects to **chew** and **digest**. And this can have a negative effect on insects health over time. So back to the example of caterpillars, excess carbon dioxide has increased the amounts of **starch** in many plants the caterpillars eat. And starch makes the leaves tough and hard to chew. When the caterpillar is limited to eat these tough starch leaves, the caterpillar often can't **gain** weight and develop normally.

Through human actions and loss of habitat, the number of wolves in the United States has dropped substantially over the past 200 years. In large parts of the American West, wolves completely disappeared. Recently environmental researchers have tried to try to **restore** the wolf population to its former state in some locations by importing wolves from areas where they are still plentiful. However, reintroducing wolves in national parks and rural areas carries several risks.  
  
One problem is that wolves are highly effective predators, and their reintroduction upsets the balance of the local ecosystem. In Yellowstone National Park, for example, the **elk** population **declined by** more than 50 percent during the first fifteen years after wolves were introduced. (Elk are large plant-eaters that influence the growth of many plants and provide food for predators other than wolves, such as bears.)  
  
A second problem is that wolves present an economic threat in the areas where they are introduced. For example, there are quite a few livestock ranches that **border** nature reserves and state parks where wolves have been reintroduced. Wolves have been known to attack large livestock such as sheep. Thus, many ranchers fear that the reintroduction of wolves will result in serious economic losses for them.  
  
A third problem is that wolves present a direct danger to humans. Wolf **packs** tend to do well in the environments in which they are introduced, so their population grows over time, and eventually they spread into new territory, places where they come into more frequent contact with people. This is especially true in national parks, where people gather to explore and appreciate nature. Introducing wolves to these areas creates a serious risk for the people who visit the areas or live in them.

**听力**

Actually reintroducing wolves in some areas is a good idea. The concerns you read about in the passage are not very serious. First, it’s true that reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone Park reduced the elk population, but it’s not true that this harmed the ecosystem. On the contrary, you see, originally more than 100 years ago, both elk and wolves lived in the Yellowstone ecosystem. But when the wolves disappeared from Yellowstone, the elk population became unnaturally large. The elk started overgrazing the vegetation in the park, endangering many plants that were important in that ecosystem. Bringing wolves back to Yellowstone has actually restored the natural balance in the park. It stopped the overgrazing of vegetation by the elks, and because of that, many important plants were able to recover.

The passage also claims that ranchers are afraid they will lose a lot of their sheep and other livestock to wolves. Well, wolves typically attack farm animals only if their natural wild food is too scarce. But wild animals that wolves prey on are plentiful in the areas where the wolves have been reintroduced, and even if some wolves do harm livestock, the rancher is paid for damages out of a government fund. So in practice, there is no real economic threat to farmers from the introduction of wolves.

Third, wolves posing a danger to humans. Well, people tend to be afraid of wolves, just like they’re afraid of any large predator. What’s probably contributing to this fear is that since the reintroductions, people have been hearing wolves in areas where wolves haven’t lived for many decades. Wolves howling is very loud and can sound very frightening if you’re not used to it. But the fear of wolves is not really based on fact. There have been very few documented wolf attacks on humans in the United States, and none of them involved reintroduced wolves.

**作文**

The author of the reading passage declared that reintroducing wolves in national parks and rural areas brings some risks. However, the professor provides a compelling counterpoint, contesting these claims with well-structured arguments.

Firstly, in the listening, the professor challenged the author’s statement that wolves’ reintroduction upsets the balance of the local ecosystem. She believed that the ecosystem balance will not be destroyed by the wolves. In contrast, it is the disappearance of wolve that will harm the balance. She mentioned that after the disappearance of wolves in certain area, an unnaturally large number of Elk emerged on the land. These Elk, instead of the wolves, destroyed the ecosystem by overgrazing the vegetation in the park. Therefore, by letting the wolves in, they controlled the number of Elk and allowed many important plants to recover, thus playing an important role in the natural balance.

Secondly, the professor refuted the author’s claim that wolves present an economic threat. They only eat livestocks when their natural wild food is really scarce. She argued that although wolves do harm some livestock, they government fund will pay for the damage.

Lastly, while the reading implied that wolves are dangerous to humans directly, the professor thought that it’s not based on the fact, there are hardly documented wolf attacks on human in the United States, and none of them involved reintroduced wolves. People tend to be afraid of wolves just like other large creatures, and they are afraid of wolves terrible howing, too.

In most species of deer, the males have antlers. These bony, branching structures atop the animal's head begin growing in the spring and continue developing throughout the summer and fall. Starting in late winter the antlers drop off, and the cycle starts all over again in the spring. Why deer grow antlers has long been a source of speculation. Below are three theories about the function of deer antlers.  
  
First, some biologists have proposed that the antlers' main function is to help the animal **dissipate** excess body heat. It is thought that wind blowing through the antlers cools the blood circulating in them. Antlers contain many blood vessels while they are growing, and a large volume of blood can fill them. Consequently, the antlers allow a lot of blood to be cooled by breezes, keeping the animal from overheating.  
  
A second theory is that antlers -hard, pointy structures - evolved for defense against predators. Animals that evolved horns, a bony structure similar to antlers, clearly use them in self-defense. Just as bulls and male goats use their horns to **combat** would-be attackers, deer may use their antlers to defend themselves against animals that try to harm them.  
  
According to the third theory, antlers function as a signal used by male deer to communicate their dominance to each other. Specifically, large-size antlers are believed to signal superior strength. According to this theory, males with large antlers are perceived as dominant by males with smaller antlers. Signaling through antlers is supposed to prevent unnecessary fights according to the theory, when two males confront each other, the one with the smaller antlers will walk away rather than engage in a physical fight against a stronger rival.

**听力**

The theories, the reading presented about the purpose of deer antlers may sound plausible, but the more you know about deer and their antlers, the less convincing they seem. 

First, if the purpose of the antlers is to cool the animal, then why do dear keep their antlers long after summer is over? Indeed, in some species of deer, the antlers are still growing, getting larger in the winter when there's no need for cooling down. Furthermore, deer in the hottest **regions** of the world tend to have the smallest antlers, while deer in the cooler **regions** often have the largest antlers. This pattern doesn't make any sense if the purpose of antlers is to help cool animals. 

Second, if antlers served his defense against predators, then we would expect female deer to grow them. After all, only the female deer care for and protect the young. But female deer usually don't have antlers In fact, we have evidence that dear generally defend themselves in a different way. The main predator of deer in many parts of the United States is the wolf, and a study of wolves showed that wolves often had injuries caused by deer kicking them. 

Third, the idea that antlers serve as a signal of dominance. Well, there have been many observations of male deer confronting each other to establish which one is dominant. The males face each other, walk up and down in parallel lines, make **grunts** and other kinds of sounds, and they do this until one of them turns around and walks away. But the result of these confrontations is not determined by antler size. Often the deer with the bigger antlers walks away without trying to fight, so it doesn't seem the antlers send a clear signal about dominance.

**作文**

The author of the reading passage declared three theories about the function of deer antlers. However, the professor provides a compelling counterpoint, contesting these claims with well-structured arguments.

Firstly, in the listening, the professor challenged the author’s statement that the antler can help deer cool down their bodies. She argued that their antlers not only exist in hot summer, but also exist or even still grow in winter. What's more, deer in the hottest regions tend to have the smallest antlers while deer in the cooler regions usually have the largest antlers. Therefore, this feature/phenomenon contradicted the viewpoint mentioned in the reading. 

Secondly, while the reading mentioned the antlers are evolved for defense against predators, the professor believed it’s not the truth. Although female deer usually take care of children and protect them, female deer don’t have antlers. This means the theory of antlers are used for defense is not reasonable. Besides, instead of using antlers to defend, when facing their biggest predator, usually the wolf, deer offten kick wolves for defensing. Therefore, the theory is not true.

Lastly, the professor refuted the author’s claim that antlers are used to show signal of dominance. In fact, deer use other way to confront with each other and decide the dominance instead of compare the size of antlers. They face each other and walk up and down in parallel lines with making grunts and other kinds of sounds to confront with rival.

The author of the reading passage declared three theories about controlling the spread of invasive Northern Pacific sea stars. However, the professor provides a compelling counterpoint, contesting these claims with well-structured arguments.

Firstly, in the listening, the professor challenged the author's statement that quicklime can reduce Northern Pacific sea star populations. He argued that the quicklime would also harm the local ecosystem by harming the native sea star, which is critical to the local ecosystem. Besides, it would be active for a long time. As a result, if the native sea stars move to another sea floor, they will die.

Secondly, while the reading mentioned that introducing parasites will naturally control the spread of Northern Pacific sea star populations, the professor believed it's not the truth. Although male sea stars can be infected by parasites, the female sea stars will be alive. A female sea star can produce 200 million eggs, so this strategy will not impact the sea star population.

Lastly, the professor refuted the author's claim that treating ballast water can be a solution. In fact, the sea star can spread to a new area in another way. They can stick to the object surrounding them, such as sticking to the bottom of a boat, and then they can move to other places.

**听力**

Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic you just read about.  
  
Unfortunately, while the measures described in the reading will help, none will really stop invasive northern pacific sea stars from spreading. First, quicklime doesn't hurt **commercially** important **mollusks**. That doesn't mean it's safe for the entire marine ecosystem. You see, this poison destroys not only invasive northern pacific sea stars, but also native ones. And native sea stars are critical to maintaining their local ecosystems. Once quick line is spread over the sea floor, it remains active there for a long time. And that'll be a problem for native sea stars. Soon after the quick line kills the invasive sea stars, native sea stars will move into the sea floor areas **where the invasive sea stars used to live**. And when that happens, they'll die too.  
  
Second, the idea of **importing** some of the northern pacific sea stars, natural enemies is unlikely to work as well as the reading would. Have you believe? The problem with parasites is that they do not completely destroy male northern pacific, sea stars, reproductive system. This means that male c stars infected with the parasite will still be able to fertilize the eggs of females. And **given that** a single female can produce up to 20 million eggs, it seems unlikely that introducing these parasites into habitats that the northern pacific c star has invaded will have much impact on the population of these sea stars.  
  
Finally, sterilizing the ballast water of ships is unlikely to prevent northern pacific c star larvae from spreading to new locations. Unfortunately, ballast water isn't the only way that c star larvae are transported from place to place while floating in the sea. Northern pacific c star larvae stick to **objects** around them. **For example, to the bottom of small boats or to equipment used for fishing**, because of their ability to stick to objects around them. Invasive northern pacific sea stars will likely continue to spread to new areas **regardless** of whether ships **sterilize** their ballast water or not. 

Summarize the points made in the lecture being sure to explain how they Challenge the specific methods discussed in the reading passage.

Claire presents a compelling argument that making advance plans for free time is beneficial. Admittedly, the plan can make people do things more carefully. However, considering the various benefits of having no plan for free time, I agree more with Kelly’s statement.

In my opinion, free time means relaxation, while plans brings pressure that hinders my relaxation.

In my opinion, avoiding plans will also avoid pressure of following the plan. Just as Kelly said, in my spare time, I want to relax without plans. Because I want to fully relax during my spare time, I don't want to feel anxious and nervous, especially when there is a plan I have to follow. 

For example, I study Japanese as a hobby in my free time. I never have any schedules for it, so I learn it happily and carefree. This allowed me to study for a prolonged time. Actually, I am very good at it now, so I think relaxation is useful for us anytime.

No, the program I hear a few times a day. It's *a minute or two long*.

You mean moment of science? Uh, we **broadcast** each episode four times daily.

I heard that sometimes students write them. That's true.

If we **approve** their topic.

I was hoping to do that. But I noticed that the episodes lately have all been about astronomy. I mean, *you are open to other topics, right?*

It's true. We have **featured** a lot of astronomy lately. Uh, well, for one thing, the astronomy *department* has made some major **purchase** it recently.

So we did a series of episodes on what all the new *instruments in the observatory* are used for,

right, The episode last week about *the Schmidt* camera that was really interesting.

And also professor Collins in the astronomy department, she *offers extra credit* to students who write **scripts** for the show. She even *comes down to* do the narration sometimes.

Ok, um, what i'd like to do is **write** (right) a few moments of science episodes about the **experimental conned**. The BIO **pond**, you know, over in your high school **dormitory**. Oh. Yeah.

But we just did a big **piece** (peace) on that. On science hour, **a bloomy trails** to the **pond were cut through the woods**, right?

Hello, Kathy. Actually, it's good timing that you stopped by. I was just **grading** your classes, **quizzes**, and, well, **truthfully**, it might have been helpful if you had come by before the **quiz**.

I have to say, I'm a little disappointed in your work.

You know，I thought I'd understand biology better than this. It's one of my favorite subjects.

Well，what's your approach to studying?

Well，I've got a *tutor* now.

Good. How do you prepare for those tutoring sessions?

Prepare? What do you mean?

Do you take notes on the reading, write down things to ask your tutor?

Actually, with **soccer** practice **band** and the newspaper, I **barely** have time to get the **assigned** reading **done**.

To be successful in this class. You may have to find the time.

I'm really trying, like, I was hoping I could talk to you about the homework assignment you **returned** in today's class. OK,

The homework we did about patterns of **dispersion.**

Yes, the way a plant or animal species is **distributed** over an area. There are three main patterns that we see in populations of **organisms**.

Yeah，and I thought my answers were right, but I didn't get the maximum number of points.

Your answers were Incomplete. You named the different patterns **and animal** or plant that follows each pattern. But you didn't mention the factors that cause each type of **the perjury**

**factors**. My tutor didn't really emphasize that,

but the textbook *chapter* did.

Okay, So，I know the **clump** pattern *refers to* populations where an **organism** is found in groups. Good.

What might cause that

they group together and **near** a food **source**?

That's one possible reason. Or they might be **avoiding predators**, or maybe environmental conditions in one **spot are** favorable.

Take **forest** insects, for example, many species of forest insects will **clump** under **logs**, because **humidity** there is high in the second pattern.

Uniform **dispersal**, where organisms are sort of **evenly** spaced from each other.

I remember that one that some **penguins** have that pattern, cause there was this picture in the book of penguins all **evenly** spaced apart.

Yes, **Image what Mike was money.**

I might need to read that chapter again.

Well, you will need to remember more than the pictures.

Does it mean the **penguins** don't *get along with each other*?

You are on the right track. **Uniform dispersal** tends to occur when there is competition among members of the species, when they're **territorial**.

Okay.

You see to fully understand biology, we look at the reasons behind the things we observe.

Listen to a conversation between a student and the professor of his musical theater course.

So Peter, how's that **outline** coming? That's not **due** till Friday, right? That's right. As I **recall**, you are doing research on the music of George Gershwin. You need to **narrow your topic down**, give it more **focus**. **I'm getting to that** later this week, uh, but well, what I wanted to ask about was, well, remember, I told you I'd be visiting my hometown to see **my sister perform in a community theater production**. You mentioned that last week. I'm **delighted** to see so many theater **goers** in class. I mean, it's fine to **take a course** on musical theater, learn its history. But I hope it also enhances your **appreciation**. When you see the musicals. It does. And whenever I talk to friends about a musical they've seen, and I **tell them in** with Information about it, they're so **impressed**. In fact, some of them told me they'll be **signing up** for your course next semester. That's great to hear.

Anyway, like I was saying this musical play I just saw, it's called crazy for you. And, wow, what a great performance, my sister **practically stole the show**. Well, I was really confused because the **program** said the music was by George Gershwin, but i've already started my research on Gershwin. This was before you told me I had to **narrow down** my topic. And I don't remember seeing any Gershwin musicals with that title. Good point. This actually **ties in with** something we'll discuss during our **unit** on **contemporary trends**. It's called a jukebox musical. jukebox musical? **Let me write that down.**

That's Jukebox like that old machine we found in the music department **storage** room. Probably. The jukebox was popular in the 1940s and 50s. It's a machine that stores **phonograph** records and let's users **select** the songs to be played. Like what I do with my MP3 player? Or many other electronic **devices** today. The **term** jukebox musical **was going to refer to** musicals **where** an original storyline is written to **accommodate** a set of **pre-existing** songs.

So you mean those songs in crazy for you were **composed** before the play was written? Long before. In the 1930s. And the **storyline** of the play, which was written around those songs wasn't written until 1992. Um, 1992, is that when jukebox musical **started, you know, being popular**? actually, jukebox style musical movies **have been around** since the, 1940s, but the real jukebox musicals on stage, and with a strong **plot**, well developed characters and so on. Those didn't **take off** until the early 2000s. Um, so, maybe, you know, if I research this and how the **genre** became popular, yes, and **define** it, its basic **elements**, perhaps give examples like crazy for you and include something about Gershwin songs.

Thanks for taking the time to see me on such short notice. No problem, Michelle, what's **on your mind**? It's the architecture courses i've been taking. Um. You see the projects I've done for class? My grades haven't been exactly **stellar**. I don't think my professors see much potential in my work. There are **aspects** of designing buildings that I just can't. I mean, you see, i've always loved architecture, researching it, reading about how buildings are designed. I've even visited buildings by famous architects, like Frank Lloyd Wright, but now that I have to design things myself, **having second thoughts** about whether I'm really **cut out to** be an architect.

As I recall, that's **not at all** how you felt when you were a first year student. i know. It's just that, well, I thought architecture was my talent, because you know, i've always been artistic and I'm pretty good at math. But you know, i've also become very interested in the environment and protecting the land. Maybe I'm thinking, maybe if I switched my concentration to environmental science, keep in mind, though, most of the architecture courses you've taken **thus far would not count for the degree** in environmental science, which means you'd probably need to **enroll in** a few courses during the summer.

And unless the university summer program **includes all the courses** you'd need, you might **wind up graduating later than planned.** Would would that be okay? Mhm. I'd have to pay summer school **tuition** as well, which is more than i've **budgeted for**. Maybe i'll just take...  But actually, there might be an **alternative**. Have you considered shifting your focus to landscape architecture? Landscape architecture. Is that like gardening? No, landscape architects are the people who design gardens and parks in the green spaces surrounding buildings. **Whereas** an architect would design an office **complex** or shopping center. A landscape architect would be **hired** to design the outdoor spaces **adjacent** to those buildings. Designing outdoor spaces. Yeah, that seems like something I'd really enjoy and do well at. And **according to economic projections**, I saw recently landscape architecture as a **profession** is growing. As a result, this university and **quite a few others**, as a matter of fact, have created **degree programs** in landscape architecture.

Oh, WOW. Why don't you do some research in our library or on the internet? You should also talk to my **colleague**, Sandra Hughes here in the architecture department. Professor Hughes **heads up** the landscape architecture **program**. So does that mean, if I switched my major to landscape architecture, I'd still be able to graduate next year? Possibly, many of the courses you've already taken, like computer **aided** design in history of architecture. These would probably **count toward** a degree in landscape architecture, but **definitely** talk to professors used first before changing any of your plans.

Hi，Professor Gonzales.

Hi, Mary, how can I help you?

Well，I went to the library to read the article you assigned on Francis Bacon,

The article in a **critical** history of western philosophy.

Yeah. well，they had a copy of the book, that was there, but the article itself was gone

Missing from the book. Why would anybody?

And I can't read either of the **photocopies** you had on **reserve** because they've been missing for 2 days.

Well，keep checking at the **reserve** desk. I'm sure a lot of people have been checking the **photocopies** out that article is **essential**.

Really? Why is that one article so important?

Well，for one, it discusses bacon in the early 1600s, a very important time in bacons life. When he was **pursuing** his work in natural philosophy and **rejecting** much of the traditional ways of doing science in England.

Didn't you say in class that in those days that science was mostly about following **Aristotle** sort of logic and uh, what else? And that truth was **derived** from **authority**.

Aristotle used **deductive** logic and good memory. Also, that article offers several helpful **insights** into bacon’s **mindset**, and the challenges he faced, not only in science, but in politics as well.

Well, anyway, I wanted to make sure you knew about the article, because I also remembered you mentioning something about a quiz on Friday.

Yes, but it shouldn't be a problem. You can still read the article on the internet. Our library has access to the electronic version of the book.

Alright! I almost forgot about that.

Well, it is noted in the **syllabus**. Plus I reminded everyone about the electronic version in class yesterday. You know they can set A kind of **precedent** for how we approach science by **advocating** the use of **inductive reasoning**. Still used today by the way,

You did mention the scientific **method** in class

Yes, yes I did. Can you imagine a time when scientific study wasn't **primarily** the process of observing data, recognizing patterns, and making **generalizations** from the observations?

Umm, professor, that **reminds** me of all the reading I still need to do for your quiz on Friday.

Of course, I should let you **get to** it.

No, it's **not that**. I think it's really interesting to discuss bacon and not just read about him, but it's been so difficult to access the article.

So let me guess, you'd like me to **postpone** the quiz. Am I right?

It would be **for the greater good**. And **technically**, that's why I came over here.

Well, I don't know. I think i've been pretty good about making this article available. Even if it's not in the library book, there's still no reason you can't get it and read it by Friday. Plus it wouldn't be fair to the people who have done it.

Really?Could you tell me more? It's for a **news release**. Whenever any of our students are **faculty** wins a national honor, it **reflects on** our university. So I read a **news release** and send it to the media.

This way, there's a good chance the city newspaper will **pick up** the story.

WOW,cool. I've been **quoted** in the student newspaper, but the city paper that's different.It'll bring so much **publicity** to our program.

Well.You've **earned** your moment in the spotlight. In fact, you **represent** one of the best things about our school, caring people. So let's get started. You said you **founded** the literacy program? When?

3 years ago.I volunteered after school program at the local community center. It was fun. We were helping kids learn to read.

Then one kid's mom told me she also had trouble reading, so I thought maybe I could expand the program to teach literacy skills to adults, too.

The director of the community center, he loved the idea. So now any adult can come in if they want to become better readers.

So how'd you get chosen for the achievement award? Did you apply for it?

No, the director nominated me. You can't nominate yourself, but the director submitted my name and all this Information about my volunteer work to the award committee.

But you knew beforehand that you were nominated.

No, I had no idea. Basically, I was shocked when I won. There were only like ten winners out of several hundred college students from around the country who were nominated.

Very impressive. So how many people has your program served?

We've tutored several hundred people so far.

We?

Yeah, I recruited like 12 volunteer tutors, friends, professor, I even got my family involved.

Any plans for the prize money that comes with your award? Take a vacation, maybe.

Now I'll use it for supplies for the literacy program, like workbooks and writing materials. And maybe now we can hire somebody to promote our program.We'd really like to bring in some more volunteers, so we can help more adult students.

I think I've got enough for the release now. You know,listening to you,maybe I can do some publicity for your center.I'll try to stop by soon to see if I can help.

In a geography class,

state and **federal** regulations play a significant role in balanc**ing transportation** needs an environmental protection in the United States, as we've seen.

But a lot of local governments are trying to *reduce the environmental impact of transportation*, especially to decrease the use of fossil fuels. So what's one major way they can do that?

Well, they try to find some way to encourage people to drive less.

Exactly. And one way they do that is by making decisions about how to use land.One Challenge, though, what **data** do they base land *use decisions on*?

I mean, we know in **principle** that if there's a greater density of land use, more kinds of businesses and residences in a *smaller* area, well, then people tend to drive less because the places they want to go to are closer by.

But local governments really need something more concrete than that, ***preferably pertaining** to towns like their own.*

*Unfortunately, we can't **exactly run randomized experiments** in an existing town like randomly **constructing** office buildings in some neighborhoods and not others to see the impact the **development** has on local drivers.*

So it's hard to find good research on the impact of local *planning* policies on driving behaviors.

But even with that limitation, *local governments can learn a lot from before and after studies that look at a single location and compare it to itself before and after a major change.*

Take the city in California called Davis Davis. California is interesting because until *comparatively recently*, it didn't have any super stores. You know,

those giant department stores where you can get everything from clothing to furniture to pots and pans. Well, eventually the local government allowed the opening of Davis's first superstore.

So some researchers did a **before** and after study focusing on the distance that Davis resident **strive**('s drive) to do their shopping.

What they did was *they **survey** Davis residence before the store was built and after it was opened* to see how far people drove to go shopping.

Now before the super store was opened, Davis had a **vibrant** *downtown* shopping area with lots of local businesses.

And there had been a lot of **debate** about whether a superstore would be bad for these businesses.

But rather than thinking about it from an economic **standpoint**, let's just think about it from an environmental one.

What do you think happened? How do you think this new store affected driving patterns?

Well, when you think about it, you can get so many things at a superstore.

Maybe people could just go to that store once in awhile and **stock up** on a variety of stuff, rather than going out to a different store every time they needed something. 

I mean, they can be so *inconvenient* to get to. Super stores are usually located out of the way off some major road **instead of** close to where people live.

Who's going to walk or ride a bike *all the way out* there? I don't see them causing a reduction in driving. *If anything, it'd be the opposite* because that's really the only way to get there.

You both make some good points.You see, the effect of the super store really depends on what kinds of shopping it **replaces**.

And in the case of Davis, there was some decrease in shopping downtown after the super store opened. But it wasn't as greater decrease as many people **feared** it would be.

Where we really saw change was in *how many people were shopping outside of Davis in neighboring cities.*

It looks like a lot of Davis residents had already been shopping at superstores **farther** away in other towns.

So when the super store opened in Davis, people didn't have to drive *as far to do their one stop shopping.*

So does this mean that building a superstore there was actually better for the environment?

Well, I wouldn't go that far. You see, the **average** *driving* distance for shoppers is just one aspect of a store's **impact on emissions**.

We also have to consider other factors, like where are the **items sold in that store** manufactured, and how are they manufactured? What **distance** are the products **shipped**, and how.

Listen to part of a lecture in a marine biology class.

Now, the deep sea is a **hostile** environment for animals to live in.Two **chief** factors that make it so **hazardous** are one very low temperatures and two, the intensity of **hydrostatic** pressure.

**Hydrostatic** pressure refers to the weight of a **liquid** pushing down on something. The deeper in the ocean, an **organism** is found, the more water there is pushing down, **exerting** pressure on it.

For example, take the **Caribbean Sea**, marine animals in its shallow waters live in very **mild** temperatures and the pressure isn't much different from *what's experienced on **land**.*

In **comparison**, if an animal **dove** down into the deepest part of the Caribbean, thousands of meters deep, temperatures would be **extremely frigid**.

And the **hydrostatic** pressure would feel like, well, imagine living beneath the weight of **dozens of jumbo jet airplanes**. How does such an environment affect animals?

Well, both low temperature and high pressure act on the body to slow down biological functions, low temperature, **stiffens** the cells in the body, reducing their movement.

But think of, say, meat for cooking at **room** temperature, meat is soft and flexible, but when it's frozen, it's **stiff and solid**.

Now, that's an **extreme** example, but I think it clearly makes the point and high pressure has a similar effect. High water pressure **compresses**, squeezes every **cell**.

It also **stiffens** the body which slows down biological functions when an animal is **exposed** to both high pressure and low temperature as in the deep sea.

The two effects **compound** each other, making it even more difficult for biological processes, growth, **respiration**, metabolism to operate.

Of course, the process *critical* for species *survival is reproduction*.

Deep sea conditions cause *production* of eggs and development of offspring to take much more time and energy than they do **within** a warm, shallow water environment.

And this *calls for* special energy saving **adaptations**.

Now, fortunately, for researchers, most deep sea animals *have very similar **relatives** that live in shallow waters, different species, but they're still closely related.*

So this makes things pretty **convenient** for us. We can see the **adaptations**, the changes. *Case in point* the **squat** lobster, the **squat** lobster isn't a true lobster.

It looks maybe more like a *crab*. There are numerous species living at different ocean **depths**.

We've *observed that the size of the eggs produced by **squat** lobsters increase in size, **in proportion to** the depth of their habitat, the greater the depth, the larger the eggs.*

you see, bigger eggs contain more fat. This provides the **larvae**, the newly **hatched** young with more energy for growth, increasing their **chances** of survival.

But **note**, this **adaptation** does *come at a **cost***. Females have only limited amounts of energy **available** for *reproduction*.

So **whereas squat** lobsters from shallow waters produce lots of small eggs.

Deep sea females **devote** extra energy to producing each egg and produce *only a small number*.

But these eggs are bigger, more energy rich, and more **resistant** to the environmental **dangers**. So it's really a **trade off**.

Interestingly, a different method of **adaptation**, one that does allow production of large numbers of eggs in the deep sea is **illustrated by the copper pod**.

**Copper pods** are tiny **crustaceans**, meaning related to **crabs** and lobsters that **inhabit virtually** all **salt** water and *fresh water environments.*

Deep sea **copper pod** eggs *undergo a process* called **vertical** migration.

That is the eggs migrate **vertically** or move upward as a group through the water. As we've discussed, **larvae** development in the deep sea is *a slow energy intensive process.*

**Copper pots** meet this Challenge by laying many small eggs that are very **buoyant**. They **float**.

This **buoyancy** comes from a kind of *oil* contained in these eggs, the eggs which are laid in deep water, migrate **vertically**, perhaps several kilometers into shallower waters.

There, in a warmer environment with lower pressure, the smaller eggs can survive. Once the **copper pots larvae hatch**, they sink back down to where they came from.

In this way, deep sea species can produce similar **quantities** of eggs as their shallow water **cousins**.

But again, **there's always a catch**, because the eggs of the deep sea **copper pod** travels so far.

*There's a good chance* that some will be lost in ocean **currents**, never returning to the place where they started.

Listen to part of a lecture in a film studies class.

When we talk about film as an art *form* **worthy** of serious study, we often associate a film with its director, but what about the **screenwriter** who wrote the **script** or **came up with** the story?

Or the **cinematographer** who chooses the camera lenses, *frames the **shots*** and chooses a lighting? If I asked you to name some directors, I'm sure you could come up with a whole list.

Absolutely.

Okay. Now how about **cinematographer**?

Anyone?

A **cinematographer**, not even one, right?

Guess not.

There's no doubt that the director **bears** most of the responsibility for a movie and its artistic qualities.

But that idea often leads to the view that the director deserves all the **credit**. This view *goes back to* the **concept** of "the filmmaker" that **arose** in France in the mid 1900s.

Such a director was called an **hotel**. And that **concept** of film making became known as **all tale ism**.

So when a director is **referred** to as a **hotel**, *it is implied that the directors in total control of all the artistic elements of the film, and that the directors goal is to create a work of art.*

**Hotel ism** is the view that a film's director is the **sole** creative **force** behind the film.

People who hold this view **claim** that artistically successful films **bear** the personal **stamp** of the director.

A number of famous and very successful movies were made in the mid 1900s whose directors were considered **hotels**.

And these films had a profound impact on the movie business in the United States.

*The willingness of some **commercial studios** to give directors more artistic control over their filmmaking, attracted new directors to the industry and allowed them greater freedom in **experimenting** with innovative techniques.*

But this idea that a film's artistic success can be **attributed** to a single person doesn't truly **capture** how films are made.

Just consider a film that's widely considered the masterpiece of a great **hotel** director, citizen Kane by Orson Welles. Wells **co wrote** the **screenplay**, **directed** the movie and **starred** in it.

So when people *analyze* the film, they talk about it as his.

And when they explain why it's so great, one of the things they point to is its camera work, the camera angles, the way the actors are **framed**.

That is its **cinematography**, but the **cinematography** of the film was largely **handled** by someone else, **Greg Toland**.

The **cinematography** was innovative for a film in the 1940s, and **tolands experiments** with new camera techniques are part of what makes well as film so **daring**.

For example, the most innovative technical **aspect**, the **extensive** use of what's called deep focus **cinematography**.

You know how, in some films or photographs, the people right in front of the camera, the *foreground* are in **sharper** focus than the ones in the background.

This focusing at one **distance** at a time, *was the only type of focus possible until the 1940s, but in deep focus, everything, foreground background in between. It's all in **sharp** focus.*

In this scene, the young Charles foster Keynes being placed into the care of his **guardian**, the man on the **far left**. Kane's mother hopes he *will be able to provide* a better life for the boy.

Kane's father in the back doesn't want his son to leave. But since the mother **controls**(can choose) the family's finances, he can do nothing but watch.

Now, in a film made without deep focus, only the characters in the front in the foreground would be in focus. Everything else would be **blurry**.

But as you can see, in this image, everything's in perfect focus. This **heightens** the drama, because we can see kane's father's reaction to what's happening in the foreground.

And the fact that he's farther from the camera *reinforces* the **sense** that *he doesn't have a **say in** making decisions about the boy's future.*

So I guess if **toland** was responsible for using the technique on this movie, that means wells shouldn't be considered the **hotel**.

But even though tolen used the technique in **novel** ways, wouldn't it still have been wells who decided how and when to use it to put his personal **stamp** on the film?

Well, **ultimately**, you will *each* have to decide for yourselves what do you think about *this specific case*? Whether you think the **term hotel** **rightly applies** to wells or not?

But as we *go forward* in this *course*, please keep in mind these questions about **autism**. Because we'll be coming back to them again and again, as we study more films.

Listen to part of a lecture in a history class.

Okay? So we've been talking about the **indigenous** people's living in the **Americas before the arrival** of the **Europeans**. in the last class, we began talking more specifically about **indigenous** empires. And today, we'll have a look at the **Inca** empire. The political center of the **Inca** empire was in the city of **Cuzco** in modern day **Peru**. The empire **stretched** for **well over** 2,000 miles along the **western** coast of South America, **comprising** a few hundred thousand **square** miles of territory, more than any other empire in the **Americas**, compared with other **indigenous** empires.

The rise of the **Inca** empire was truly **mediocre**. The **Inca** began building their empire in the early 1400s, and it **expanded** very rapidly. Then, after only 100 years or so, in **existence,** the empire came **crashing down**.

Now, in most history books, the rise of the **Inca** empire is **attributed** primarily to the leadership of two men. **爸爸** and his son **儿子**. Now 爸爸 and 儿子 were almost certainly **cunning** leaders. And there's not much doubt they were **instrumental** in the **extraordinarily** rapid **expansion** of the inca empire. But over the two centuries before 爸爸 and 儿子 **rose to power**. That is in the twelve hundred and thirteen hundreds. Their **ancestors** had already been employing a variety of **clever tactics** to take control of **crucial resources** in the region. And they very skillfully develop those **resources**. For example, they **constructed** a system of **terraces** and **irrigation canals** that would eventually enable **Cuzco** to produce significant agricultural **surpluses**. **Surpluses** that 爸爸 and 儿子 would one day **distribute throughout** the empire to help **persuade** millions of people to accept **Inca** rule. And, it wasn't just this pre-existing, highly developed base in the **heartland** around **Cuzco** that enable these two leaders to engineer such rapid territorial **expansion**.

Most of the neighboring societies were in continual **conflict** with one another. So they weren't **in a position** to **align** with one another to **resist** the **Inca advances** and all this **ongoing conflict** made less powerful societies feel **insecure**. So many of them actually wanted to be **incorporated** into the Inca empire. **So as to** enjoy the protection they **receive**. So, in the early stages of empire building, the **Inca met** very little **opposition**, and were able to **gain** a lot of power quickly and easily. So, to what **extent** was the rapid rise of the great **Inca** empire, simply a natural **consequence** of a highly developed **heartland a couple hundred years in the making** in **combination** with surrounding territories, **right for the taking**.
 
And to what **extent** was it the result of the **brilliant** leadership of 爸爸 and 儿子? Well, that's hard to know, because much of our knowledge about the rise of the empire comes from histories told by **various** groups of **Inca** and **Cuzco**. Royal king groups that were in competition with one another. And the **purpose** of those histories was not, as you might **assume**, to supply a true **record** of th e past. It **was rather** to serve the political **aims** of those who were telling the histories. Um, but fortunately, we're still finding valuable **archaeological** evidence. And, we're hoping that will eventually help us **sort out** the truth. Uh, but one conclusion i've **come to**, after many years of studying history, and, that I'd like you to keep in mind as you continue in your study of history, is that no individual. no matter how brilliant or charismatic can **ever bring about** great change, unless the conditions of that place and time are right for them to do so.

Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class.

Now, during the heyday of the Roman empire, **say** the first 350 years or so, starting around 27 bce,

Rome was the political and economic center of Europe. And **needless** to say, its **emperors** controlled a lot of **wealth**.

One of the ways in which they used their wealth was by building **dozens of villas**, **massive** country homes throughout Italy and **southeastern** Europe.

And while they were **impressive** with temples, libraries, **baths**, gardens, and outdoor pools, these **imperial** villas were about quite a bit more than just **impressing** people.

One practical purpose was to give the emperors a place to escape from the **heat** of Rome's summers.

In the 18th century, when people first started **excavating** some of these villas, it was basically just treasure hunters.

People **looking to** get wealthy by **unearthing marble** sculptures, **frescoed** rooms that sort of thing.

But it was only through more serious **excavation**'s beginning in the 19th century that archaeologists first began to develop a more detailed picture of these estates.

Some of the artwork they found gives us a window into the differences between the official and private lives of the emperor.

In the villa of Tiberius, an early emperor.

In his villa on the Mediterranean coast near Naples, archaeologists found a lot of marble fragments, which when put together, turned out to be a group of massive marble sculptures of creatures, out of Roman mythology.

It's the kind of storytelling scene you might not see in the city of Rome itself. Sculpture in the city was all about glorifying the emperor.

But in the country, emperors were able to experiment more and experiment they did. The emperor Hadrian villa, for instance, contains examples of many different architectural styles.

Hadrian was one of the most well traveled emperors, and this was reflected in his villa. He built a large, complex that included baths and bath buildings, libraries, sculpture, gardens, theaters, and temples in Egyptian Greek and Roman styles.

Villas also served an economic purpose. Many were self supporting working farms. They planted grain and some had vineyards and produced wine.

These villas were less like summer homes and more like estates where hundreds of people could live and work.

There's one, in particular, I want to mention that belonged to the emperor die accretion, who ruled at the end of the third and into the 4th century Ce.

When archaeologists first looked around I occasions estate, which is located in modern day Croatia, they found an aqueduct designed to carry water to the villa.

But it seemed much too big just to be supplying a residence. This got them interested.

So they took a closer look at the area around the villa and found that it was ideal for making fabric.

We know that there were lots of sheep in the surrounding hills at the time. And the local water had sulfur in it, which is good for making dyes.

So by piecing together this Information about the environment around the villa, as well as the size of the aqueduct.

We can pretty safely assume that dye equations, estate was the site of a textile factory, one that probably employed thousands of people.

And going back to Tiberius villa, their archaeologists found several rectangular depressions filled with sea water.

At first, we thought they were just decorative pools, which you see in many Roman estates.

But when we took a closer look, it turns out there were little round holes set into the sides of the pools.

These holes would be the perfect size for fish to lay their eggs in. So it looks like these pools were actually a fish farm.

And it would have produced enough to feed everyone in the villa, maybe even to supply fish markets in Rome.

Now, right from the beginning of the Roman empire, there were landowners who also built villas.

They built big estates with farms or factories to generate income.

And eventually, they were all of these villas out in the country, each with quite a bit of economic power and with such strong economies in the villas, power became decentralized.

It's possible that as the villas expanded and the political situation of Rome got more and more unstable, these high producing estates might have actually contributed to the decline of the empire.

Continental drift refers to the idea that the present continents once formed a single. giant continent called Pangaea, and since that time have been slowly drifting apart. In 1915 the originator of this idea, the German meteorologist Alfred Wegener, was impressed by the close resemblance of coastlines of continents on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, particularly South America and Africa. However,the configuration of the coastlines results from erosional and depositional processes and therefore is constantly being modified, so even if Wegener was right and the continents had separated in the distant past, it is not likely that the coastlines would fit exactly. But decades later it was shown that the continents fit together well along the continental slope (the broad underwater shelf on the edges of continents), where crosion is minimal, and recent studies have confirmed the close fit between continents when they are reassembled to form Pangaea.

大陆漂移是指以前的大陆Pangaea是单一的大陆，后面分开了。研究中大西洋两岸海岸线相似但不完全一样，但也有证明紧密结合的证据。

If the continents were at one time joined, then the rocks and mountain ranges of the same age in adjoining locations on the opposite continents should closely match. Such is the case for the continents thought to have together formed the southern supercontinent Gondwana when Pangaca broke up into a northern and a southern supercontinent, mostly during the Jurassic period (200-146 million years ago) Antarctica, South America, Africa,Australia-New Guinea, and India comprised Gondwana. Marine, nonmarine, and glacial rock sequences of the Pennsylvanian epoch(325-299 million years ago)to the Jurassic period are almost identical for all five Gondwana continents, strongly indicating that they were joined at one time. The trends of several major mountain ranges also support the hypothesis of continental drift. The folded Appalachian Mountains of North America, for example, trend northeastward through the eastern United States and Canada and terminate abruptly at the Newfoundland coastline. Mountain ranges of the same age and deformational style occur in eastern Greenland, Ireland Great Britain, and Norway. Even though these mountain ranges are currently separated by the Atlantic Ocean, they form an essentially continuous mountain range when the continents are positioned next to each other.

Biologists, who commonly study the distribution of plant and animal species in different environments their biogeography strive to develop interpretations or explanation of the patterns of species distribution, but these may be incorrect if the effects of human beings are not taken into consideration. In some cases, these effects may be accidental; for example, some species of rat were unintentionally transported aboard ships from Europe to the islands of the South Pacific. In other cases, species distributions may have been deliberately modified by human beings. The Polynesians in the South Pacific intentionally moved the kumara(sweet potato) to islands in that region to provide the population with a new food crop.

The relocation of species by humans (and more recently the imposition of restrictions on movement by way of national controls and world conventions)has been primarily for economic reasons and for environmental protection. For example, humans introduced Sitka spruce trees into Scotland and England from North America to use them as a timber crop. Similarly the Monterey pine tree was introduced into New Zealand in the nineteenth century from California and has become the most widely used species in the timber production industry in that country. The potato has been carried from its native home in the high Andes of South America, modified and developed into many varieties and transported around the world because it can be used as a food crop. The plant formerly known as the Chinese gooseberry was relocated from its native China to New Zealand where an industry was established around the renamed kiwifruit.

- **Let's get you going** on looking for those then.We have **printed versions** of 20 **or so** psychology journals and reference section.These one published **within** last year. **Now that I think** about **it,** there's a journal **named** sleep and dream.

- Oh yeah, the article I **just copied is** from that journal, so I've **got to look** other sources.

- Okay, actually most of **our** materials are **available electronically** now.You can assess psychology databases , or electronic journals and articles through **the** library's computers. And if you **wanted** to search by the title with the word "dream" for example, just type it in and all the article with "dream" in the title will come up on the screen.

- Cool, that's great.**Too bad I can't** do this from home.

- But you can. All of the library's databases and electronic sources can be **acssesed** through any computer connected to the university network.

- Really? I can't believe I didn't know that.It still sounds like it's gonna take a while, though. you know, going through all of that information, all of those sources.

- Maybe, but you are **already narrowed your** serach down **to** articles on dream interpretation. So it shouldn't be too bad.And you probably **notice** that there's a abstract or **summary** at the top of the first page of **the** article you copied.

- When you go into the databases and electronic sources, you have the option to **display** the abstracts  on the computer screen.  Skimming **nose** to decide whether **or not** you **want to** read **the** whole article should **cut** down some time.

- Right, abstract.They will definitely make the project more **doable**.I guess I should try out the electronic search while I'm still here then, you know, just in case.

- Sure, that **computers for you** over there, and I'll be here till five this afternoon.

- Thanks.I feel a lot better about this assignment now.

<summary>TPO1 Conversation 2</summary>

- Hi **Matthew**, I'm glad you **could** come in today.

- you've been observing Mr. **Grabell's** thrid-grade class for your **Approaches** eduction paper, right?

- um, yes. I go over the **Johnson elementary** school, you know **to watch** Mr. Grabell teach children in class.

- It's been amazing, I mean **I'm** just learning so much from just watching him.

- I'm so glad **that classroom observations are a** aquirement for the education **program**.

- I mean it's like the best thing ever to prepare you to be a good teacher.

- Well, I'm glad to see you feel that **way**, Matthew.

- You know, that's the goal.

- So, I've been reading over your observation notes, and I'm quite **interested** in what's going on—in particular with the astronomy unit he's been teaching.

- The astronomy unit?

- It seems Mr Grabell has master the **interdisciplinary** approach **to** teaching that we've been talking about in class.

- Oh, okay. Yeah, so like when he was teaching them astronomy, he didn't just teach them as **planets**. he used **it as** way to teach **mythology**.

- Really? so, how did him do that?

- Well, some of the students could already name the planets, but they didn't know the name has any meaning, the stories behind them.

- So, he?

- He introduced **Greek and Roman**, as way of **explaining**.

- Like, you know how like Jupiter's biggest planet, right?And, how Jupiter was the name of the king of the **gods** in Romen **mythology**, right?

- So, since Jupiter's planet, is largest planet **in our solar** system, **it's** like the king of **the planets**, like Jupiter was **the** king of all the **gods**.

- Oh, Matthew, that's a great example!

- Yeah, and each student **chose** a planet, and **then did** research **on it** to wrtie a report and make a presentation.

- They went to the library to do the reaserch, then they **made presentations** about the planet they **chose**.

- So in one science unit, in which the focus was astronomy, the students also learned about the literature of **Greek and Roman mythology**, used research skill in the library, wrote report, and **practiced** their **oral** presentations skills. 

- Exactly, he **used** this one topic to teach third **graders** all **that** stuff, how to use the books in the library to write reports, and even how to speak in public.

- Plus they have a great time doing it.

- You know, Matthew, this is just we've been talking about in our class.

- And I'm sure everyone **could** learn something from your experience.

- You know Matthew, I'd love you to talk about the **Astronomy Unit** in class on **Wednesday**.

- Really? Um, cuz I don't really think **I'll** have any time to write **my** paper by then.

- Oh you **won't need** to write anything new just yet.

- For **Wednesday**, use your class observation **notes**, and explain things **we've discussed** today.

- Okay, that's sounds allright.

<summary>TPO1 Lecture 1</summary>

- ***Narrator***: Listen to part of a lecture in a contemporary art class.

- ***MALE PROFESSOR***: OK, I’m going to begin this lecture by giving you your next assignment. Remember I said that at some point during this semester I wanted you to attend an exhibit at the **Ferry** Street Gallery and then write about it? Well, the exhibit that I want you to attend is coming up, it’s already started in fact, but it’ll be at the gallery for the next month, which should give you plenty of time to complete this assignment.

- The name of the artist exhibiting there is Rose Frantzen.Frantzen's work may be unfamiliar to you, since she’s a relatively young artist, but she’s got a very unusual style, compared to some of the artists we’ve looked at this term, but anyway, Frantzen's style is what she herself calls Realistic Impressionism. So you’ve probably studied both of these movements... separately, separate movements . . . Realism and Impressionism in some of your art history courses,so who can just sum these up?

- ***FEMALE STUDENT***: Well, Impressionism... started in the late nineteenth century.Uh, the basic Impressionist style was very different from earlier styles...it didn't **depict** scenes or models exactly as they looked.Uh, Impressionist painters tended to apply paint really thickly, and in big **brushstrokes**, so the **texture** of the canvas was rough.

- ***MALE PROFESSOR***: Good... what else?What were the subjects?

- ***MALE STUDENT***: Well, a lot of Impressionist artists painted everyday scenes, like people on the streets, and in cafes, uh, lots of nature scenes, especially landscapes.

- ***MALE PROFESSOR***: Good, so when you go to the exhibit, I really want you to take a close look at a certain painting—it's a farm scene,and you’ll see it right as you enter the gallery.The reason I think this painting is so important is that it stresses the Impressionist aspect of Frantzen's style. It’s an outdoor scene, an everyday scene,it’s kind of bleak, but you can really see those broad brushstrokes, and the **blurry** lines.The colors aren't quite realistic—the sky's kind of, well, an unnatural pinkish yellow,and the fence in the foreground is blue, but somehow the overall scene gives an impression of a cold, bleak winter day on a farm.So that's the Impressionist side of her work.

- Oh, and speaking about farms, that reminds me—one interesting thing I read about Frantzen is that when she first moved back to Iowa after living abroad, she often visited this place in her town called the Sales Barn.And the Sales Barn, it was basically this place where the local farmers bought and sold their cattle, their farm animals.And the reason Frantzen went there—and she later on would visit other places, like dance halls, was to observe people and the ways that they moved.She really found that this helped her work, that it gave her an understanding of body movements and actions, how humans move—and stand still, what their postures were like, too.

- So, what about Realism?What are the elements of Realism we should be looking for in Frantzen’s work?

- ***MALE STUDENT***: Uh, real, honest depictions of **subject matter**, pretty unidealized stuff. And pretty everyday subject matter, too.

- ***MALE PROFESSOR***: Good, one other painting I really want you to look at is of a young woman surrounded by pumpkins.You'll notice that the woman’s face is so realistic looking that it's almost like a photograph.The woman’s nose is a little less than perfect, and her hair is kind of **messed up**—this is Realism.But then the background of the painting—this woman with the pumpkins is **wrapped** in a blanket of broad, thick brushstrokes, and—it's all kinds of zigzagging brush strokes and lines, kind of chaotic almost, when you look at it close.And there are vibrant colors—there’s lots of orange, with little hints of an electric blue **peeking out**.

- I find Frantzen to be a very accessible artist.I mean some artists, to appreciate them, you have to know their life story.But here's a little bit about Rose Frantzen's life anyway ...She attended art school, but was told by one of her **instructors** that she wasn’t good at illustration, that she should go into advertising instead. So she took advertising classes, and fine arts classes too, until she **was convinced by** the head of an advertising agency that her work was really good, that she could be an artist.

- But of course, it’s not as easy as that, and so Frantzen had to paint other people’s **portraits** at places like art **fairs**— just to make money to buy paint for her more serious artwork. No matter what, she never stopped painting, and now Frantzen's doing extremely well, and her work’s being shown all over the country. 

- So, I think most of us would be discouraged if we had to face challenges and difficulties like that,but what's important is that you keep at it, that you don’t give up.That’s what’s really important to remember.

<summary>TPO50 Conversation 1 </summary>

Narrator:

Listen to a conversation between a student and a political science professor.

Student:

I’m not sure if you know but I would like to go to the student government this year.

Teacher:

Oh, congratulations! I was in student government myself as an undergraduate. It taught me a lot about the political process. In fact, the experience solved my problem of what to do with my life. It really **cemented** my interest in becoming a political scientist.

Student:

Cool! Anyway, the reason I came by is we are getting ready to conduct a **straw** poll on campus, you know, hold an informal **ballot** since the general election is just a couple of months away. We want to get a field from the students' bodies political **leanings**, like who students are planning to vote for, which political party people identify with, that sort of thing.

Teacher:

I’m sure. I help students run the straw poll once years ago, uh, it was a lot of work. Mostly because we use paper ballots, and stayed up all night counting them. But if you use computers……

Student:

Yeah, we are creating a website for our students to be able to vote online. Em, we are looking for a faculty advisor to help, actually. I was hoping you might be interested.

Teacher:

Oh, I’m **flattered**, John. But my schedule is so jammed. I’m teaching two seminars, your intro-course, finishing up my research. But, what about Professor Clan? She is new in our department. Plus, she is a **wiz** with computers.

Student:

Ok, I will ask her.

Teacher:

So, have you decided on the topic for your term paper yet?

Student:

Not really.

Teacher:

Why not write about your straw poll? Since the paper is not due till after the election, you could include your results. Maybe compare them with the real election results.

Student:

But would that be enough? I mean, just comparing numbers?

Teacher:

Well, no, you need to provide some analysis, too. But I was thinking, there is a couple of local ballot questions this year. You know, **referenda**, the voters can either support or not support?

Student:

Right. There is one on whether to ban smoking in restaurants, and another one……I think is whether to spend tax dollars for a new sports arena in the city.

Teacher:

Ah, Ok. Here is an idea. In regular elections, the vast majority of voters ignore referenda. They vote for their favorite candidates but avoid ballot questions. We believe it's because voters aren’t familiar with the questions or don’t understand them. But actively educating people on ballot questions right before they vote can improve referendum participation rates.

Student:

In that case, maybe we could have our straw poll website providing information on the ballot questions, like how each proposal would affect students.

Teacher:

Exactly. And when you write your paper, you could compare the students’ referendum voting rate to the general publics. And include you own analysis of the results. Plus, there is plenty of publish research on referendum voting behavior.

Student:

Thanks, Professor Miller. I have no idea the straw poll can actually help me in my course work.

<summary>TPO50 Conversation 2 </summary>

NARRATOR: Listen to a conversation between a student and the head of building maintenance.

FEMALE HEAD OF MAINTENANCE: Can I help you?

MALE STUDENT: Yeah, I, uh—I’m taking summer classes right now, and they’ve put me in Roberts dormitory, over by the library…

FEMALE HEAD OF MAINTENANCE: OK…?

MALE STUDENT: And I guess they’re, uh…painting the library, or doing something to the outside of the building…

FEMALE HEAD OF MAINTENANCE: Ah, yes, they are—they’re replacing the bricks on the outside walls.

MALE STUDENT: Well, whatever it is, it’s, like, really disturbing for those of us with windows facing the library—they’re working on the wall right opposite us. I mean, dust is everywhere, coming in the windows...and the noise… Cause we’re like, what, ten feet away, and, uh—well, it’s just not a pretty picture.

FEMALE HEAD OF MAINTENANCE: Right, well that’s why we waited until now to start work on it. I mean, most students have already left campus for summer vacation…

MALE STUDENT: Yeah, but Roberts Hall is being used by all the summer students.

FEMALE HEAD OF MAINTENANCE: Really? Housing didn’t notify us of that.

MALE STUDENT: Yeah, it’s pretty full! I mean, I can’t sleep at night ’cause of the smell, and the dust, and… you know, I’d love to just, like, close the windows, but you know, being summer and all…

FEMALE HEAD OF MAINTENANCE: Yes, I know, there’s no air-conditioning in that building…

MALE STUDENT: Right. So, I mean—we’ve got five more weeks of classes left, and we were really wondering how much longer they’re going to be working on that particular wall… Cause maybe, if it’s going to be a while, do you think they could maybe work on a different side of the building for now? One that’s not facing people’s dorm rooms? And wait till the students are gone to come back and finish this side? I mean, that way the dust and noise won’t be coming directly into our windows, while we’re here.

FEMALE HEAD OF MAINTENANCE: You know, I wish it weren’t being done this way. It doesn’t make sense. But this particular decision was made by a special committee, and their plan was finalized several months ago. Uh, they just didn’t realize there’d be students in Roberts Hall now.

MALE STUDENT: Yeah.

FEMALE HEAD OF MAINTENANCE: Plus, uh…well, the equipment is all set up, y’know, the scaffolding up on that side of the building—well, it just wouldn’t be practical to have the construction workers move everything to another side, and leave a whole side of the library all **torn up** like that.

MALE STUDENT: I guess not… Isn’t there another dorm open? Anywhere?

FEMALE HEAD OF MAINTENANCE: Not that I know— oh, wait! I overheard someone saying today that Manchester Hall isn’t being used by the City Summer Camp after all. Y’know, most years they house their participants in that dorm all summer.

MALE STUDENT: Well, there’s an idea…

FEMALE HEAD OF MAINTENANCE: Now it’s a smaller dorm, and it’s a little out of the way, but, uh…I-I bet they could move the affected students from Roberts Hall.

MALE STUDENT: Well, I think a lot of people would definitely appreciate that.

FEMALE HEAD OF MAINTENANCE: OK, well…well let me call the housing people, and then I’ll get back to you. Leave me your name and number, OK? I’ll let you know what I find out.

MALE STUDENT: Great! Thanks.

<summary>TPO50 lecture 1 </summary>

Narrator:

Listen to part of a lecture in an ancient history class.

Professor:

Ok, last time we were discussing trade and commerce during the Bronze Age. And I said a little over three thousand years ago, there was quite a lively trade among the countries along the **Mediterranean** Sea. People are making objects out of bronzes and they were using bronze tools to make other goods. And they develop trade networks to trade these goods with other countries around the Mediterranean. One of the things they traded was glass. And recently there was an archeological excavation in Egypt, on the Nile River around where enters the Mediterranean Sea where they discovered an ancient glass factory. Robert?

Robert:

I thought our textbook said the Egyptians imported their glass from other countries.

Professor:

Well, until now that’s what the evidence seemed to suggest. I mean, we have some evidence that suggested that the Egyptians were making glass objects, but not glass.

Robert:

Ok. Am……Am I missing something? They are making glass but they are not making glass?

Professor:

I said they were making glass objects, right? You see, it was previously thought that they weren’t actually making the raw glass itself that they were importing unfinished glass from Mesopotamia, which today is a region consisting of **Iraq** and parts of Syria and Turkey and Iran, and simply reworking it. Most archeologists believed that the glass factories were in Mesopotamia because that’s where the oldest known glass remains come from. You see, there was two stages of glass making. The primary production stage where they made disks of raw glass.

And there was the secondary stage where they melted the raw glass, the glass disks, and created decorative objects, so, or whatever. And from this new Egyptians’ site, we learned that the primary production stage had several steps. First they took **quartz**, a colorless transparent mineral and crushed it. Then they took that crushed quartz and mixed it with plant ash. A plant ash is just what it sounds like, the ashes left after you burnt plant material.

They slowly heated this mixture at a relatively low temperature in small vessels, containers like **jars** made out of clay. And that yielded a kind of glassy material. They took this glassy material and grounded it up into a powder and then they used **metallic** dye to color it. After that, they poured the colored powder out into disk-shaped **molds** and heated it up to very high tem peratures. So that it melted. After cooled, they break the **molds, and inside there were the glass disks. These disks were shipped out to other sites within Egypt and places around the Mediterranean. Then in the secondary phase, the disks were reheated, and shaped into decorative objects. Susan?

Susan:

So what kind of objects were people making back then?

Professor:

Well, the most common objects we found, mostly in Egypt and Mesopotamia, the most common objects were **beads**. One thing the Egyptian were very very good at was imitating precious stones. They created some beads that look so much like **emeralds** and **pearls** that was very difficult to distinguish them from the real thing. Em, and……and also beautiful vessels, ah, with narrow necks.

They were probably really valuable so they wouldn’t have been used to hold cooking oil or common food items. They were most likely used for expensive liquids, like perfume. Now the glass made at this factory was mostly red, to get this red color they used copper, in a sophisticated process. Of course, any kind of glass was very valuable so these red bottles would only have been owned by wealthy people. In fact, because it was so difficult to make, and sort of mysterious and complicated, it was probably a product produced for the royal family. And they probably used glass to show their power.

Also, beautiful expensive objects made great gifts if you are looking to establish or strength the political **alliances**. And it is quite possible that the ancient Egyptians were actually exporting glass, not just making it or importing it. The trade with Mesopotamia was probably a friendly mutual trade because a Mesopotamia glass was usually white or yellow. So Mesopotamians might accept something like, we will give you two white disks for two red disks. There is no proof of that, at least not yet.

<summary>TPO50 lecture 2 </summary>

Narrator:

Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class.

Processor:

Ok. There are two major types of classifiers in the world, people we call **lumpers** and people we call **splitters**. A lumper is someone who tries to put as many things as possible in one category. Splitters like to work for the differences and put things in as many different categories as possible.

Both lumpers and splitters work in the business of defining biological classifications. The great philosopher **Aristotle** is generally considered the first person to systematically categorize things. He divided all living things into two groups. They were either animal or vegetable. And these categories are what biologists came to call "kingdoms". So if it ran around, it was an animal, a member of the animal kingdom. And if it stood still, and grew in the soil, it was a plant, a member of the plant kingdom. This system, organizing all life into these two kingdoms, worked very well for quite a while, even into the age of the microscope.

With the invention of the microscope, in the late 1500s, we discovered the first microorganisms. We thought that some **wiggled* and moved around and others were green and just sat there. So the ones that moved like animals were classified as animals, and the more plant-like ones as plants. Oh, before I go on I must mention Carolus Linnaeus. A hundred years or so after the invention of the microscope, Carolus Linnaeus devised a simple and practical system for classifying living things, according to the ranks of categorization still in use today——class, order, family and so on.

And by further best aspect of the Linnaeus system, is the general use of binomial **nomenclature**, having just two names to describe any living organism. This replaced the use of long **descriptive** names, as well as common names which vary from place to place and language to language. Binomial nomenclature gives every species a unique and stable two-word name, agreed upon by biologists worldwide.

But not everything about this system remained unchanged. Take for example the mushroom, a fungus. It grew up from the ground and looked like a plant. So it was classified as a plant. But using the microscope we discovered that a fungus contains these microscopic **thread-like** cells that run all over the place. And so it’s actually not that plant-like. So in this case, the **splitters** eventually won, and got a third kingdom just for the fungus.

And as microscopes improved, we discovered some microorganisms that were **incredibly** small. I’m talking about bacteria. And we could see that they didn’t have what we call a **nucleus**. So they got their own kingdom, a kingdom of very tiny things without **nucleoli**. So then we had several kingdoms for plants and for animals, and the different kinds of fungus like mushrooms, and for these tiny bacteria. But we also had some other microorganisms that didn’t fit anywhere. So biologist gave them their own kingdom. And this fifth kingdom was sort of anything that doesn’t fit in the first four kingdom, which upset some people.

And then there was a question of viruses. Viruses have some characteristics of life but don’t reproduce on their own or use energy. So we still don’t know what to do with them. The lumpers want to keep viruses in the current system. Some of the splitters say to give them a separate kingdom. And the extreme splitters say that viruses have nothing at all to do with living things and keep them out of my department.

Recent research though has moved to see yet another direction. Nowadays when we want to determine the characteristics of something, we look at its biochemistry and its genetic material. And what we’ve discovered is that some bacteria are not like the others. Many of these are called **extremophiles**. They live in very strange places, in polar ice or in a boiling water of hot springs or in water so salty (that) other organisms couldn’t live there. Extremophiles tend to have a different chemistry from other bacteria, a chemistry that in some case is actually more related to plants and animals than to previously known bacteria. So what to do with this strange bacteria?

Well, one thing we’ve done is creating a new set of categories, the domains, **overarching** the different kingdoms. Biologists now recognize three domains. But even as we talk about these new domains, well, come back in a few years and it might all be different.

<summary>TPO50 lecture 3 </summary>

Narrator:

Listen to part of a lecture in the United States’ Literature class. The professor is discussing Realism.

Professor:

Ok, everyone. In our last class, we finished up Romanticism, right? So now let’s look at something completely different. Realism as a literary technic was most popular in U.S. literature from around 1860 till 1890. So it started pretty much around the time of the civil war. And I think you’ll see right away how it is different from Romanticism or any other kind of literature. There is a very specific point that makes it unique. And that is that it shows people as they are and get you to look at them and also you know the things that need to be changed in the society. And it doesn’t without being sentimental, not in that sort of over-emotional way, the way that romantic literature can. Realism tells it like it is.

Let’s look society as a whole. In the late 1800s, people were interested in the scientific method as well as rational philosophy, which says that people can discover the truth by using reason and factual analysis. So reason and facts, ok. And at the same time that realism was becoming popular, there were a lot of political and socioeconomic changes happening in the country. There was increased literacy, plus the growth of industrialism and urbanization, growth in population from immigration, and a rise in middle class affluence.

All these factors combined with the importance of reason and facts, meant readers were interested in really having a good understanding of all these changes, the changes going on in society. A **scourer** named Amy Chaplin says, and I’m just paraphrasing here, that Realism is a way to understand and deal with social change, which makes a lot of sense I think.

So then, let’s take a closer look at the trips of the trend, and how realist writers did their work. For one thing as we said, they focus on, express reality, and in great detail.They inferred **verisimilitude**. Shall I write down on board?

Students:

Um-hum.

Professor:

Ok. Verisimilitude means basically the same true or real, like say, a photograph rather than a painting in a way. In fact, that’s a good analogy. You see writers try to capture a moment in time and all its basic facts but without exaggeration, just like a camera does.

Anyway, the events, the things that happen in realistic literature are usually pretty much plausible. I mean, you figure that they can probably happen to anyone. And the characters are believable, too. And actually, they are usually even more important than the plot. There’re also……they talked the way the real people talk, authentic speaking styles from different regions, different parts of the country were captured in the text. Does that make sense? Ok.

So, besides verisimilitude, another important characteristic of realism is the narrator’s objectivity. Characters in the events were described without the narrator passing much judgment on them or anything or being too dramatic. Basically, you are reading a story without too much extra comment from the narrator.

Ok, now we have an idea of what realism was. So, who were the players? Well, two important realist novelists were Rebecca Harding Davis and Mark Twain. We’ll talk more about other realists tomorrow. But for today, let’s just start by looking briefly at these two.

Rebecca Harding Davis was an author and journalist who, like other realists, was concerned about all those social changes going on. She wrote mainly about some **marginalized* groups of the time, like women, native Americans, ah, immigrants. Now her best known book is a novella called The Life in the Iron Mills. It’s really a key text, because it’s one of the original realist works. Her works overall have been pretty much ignored for a long time. But some critics and scourers are starting to revisit them and study them more seriously. Probably more from the historical aspects of the works and……but I think that’s great.

But if we are talking about great literature, literature that’s read and enjoyed today as something more than just a way of looking at that era, the era when that was written. Well, a favorite of mine is Mark Twain. I’m sure you have read or heard of his most famous book, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. And Twain’s style, he goes back to what I said earlier, verisimilitude, the realistic way characters act and talk. You should realize too that this was quite a contrast to earlier writers in the U.S., who try to **emulate** the British writers, try to be very elegant, at the expense of Realism. You know, a lot of critics will tell you that American literature began with that book, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.

<summary>TPO50 lecture 4 </summary>

Narrator:

Listen to part of a lecture in a geology class.

Professor:

Hi, class, let’s get started. Um, last time we finished up the section of coal, so we have just two fossil fuels left to talk about. Those are petroleum and natural gas. Today I will concentrate on petroleum and we will get into natural gas tomorrow. Like coal and natural gas, petroleum has been formed over millions of years, from remains of prehistoric plants and animals.

And like coal and natural gas, it’s found in the rocks of Earth’s **crusts**. In fact, the word "petroleum" literally means "rock oil". And in its’ original state, the way we find it in Earth’s crust, it is called crude oil, sometime people will short it up, and just refer to it as crude.

Um, petroleum also contains natural gas, so usually the petroleum industry is naturally searching for and utilizing deposits of both crude oil and natural gas at the same time. In other words, companies might as well gather, use and sell both the oil and the gas when they find it, since both are valuable. And……

Student:

But what kind of organic materials, I mean, specifically what kind of dead plant and animals make up petroleum exactly? Do you mean like trees and dinosaurs?

Professor:

Well, apparently petroleum is usually made from simple, one-celled marine animals and plants, **algae**, for example. Um, what happens is this accumulated plant and animal material that originally came from the ocean gets covered by sediment. And then is…um, eventually exposed to earth internal heat and pressure, for millions of years. And over those millions of years, the heat cooks and the pressure molds that material, turning it into a thick, sticky liquid. And since petroleum is made from these ocean organisms, you can guess where it was found, it makes sense that we usually find it under the ocean or near shore, right? Yes, Ann?

Ann:

I’ve heard people talk of……ah……live and dead oils?

Professor:

Well, um, when crude oil has a lot of natural gas mixed up with it, it’s called live oil. But if the gas escapes from the mixture, then oil is said to be dead. And it’s heavy and more difficult to pump. Does anyone know how the gas separates from the oil? Sam, go ahead.

Sam:

Doesn’t it happen when the oil shoots up to the surface?

Professor:

Yes, that’s right. When oil reaches the surface of the Earth, there is less pressure on it. And with less pressure, the oil and gas were able to separate. The other way the crude oil was able to come up to the surface is by people pumping it up out of the ground. And, um, it’s the same thing that happens at the surface, there is less pressure, and, so the oil and gas separate. But when we talked about how would actually exists inside earth’s crust, most people think that there are huge, pools of oil sitting around in caverns somewhere under there. That’s really rare. The majority of petroleum is just filling in the tiny pores and cracks in rocks.

Now, um, a little more on the petroleum industry. As far as the extraction process the petroleum industry digs deep wells to reach underground oil fields where crude oil has accumulated over a large area and extract between layers of rocks. Then it pumps the crude oil out. Then its refineries have two main tasks, convert less valuable crude oil into a more valuable form and create usable products from refined oil. Basically, the refiner will do this by boiling the oil. When the oil cools off, the stuff that is left is turned into a variety of products, like gasoline, **diesel** fuel for cars and trucks, **asphalt** for roads, um, paints, plastics, even soaps. And check what you’re wearing, if you are wearing something with synthetic fibers, what that really means is that it is made of the petroleum. So you can see petroleum is essential to today’s industrial society.

Now, next week we will be joined the graduate students from the department of petroleum engineering to examine the comprehensive field study they’re working on in our local oil fields. And I’d like you to read over the pack of information I’m about to hand out to you before we go. It should familiarize you with the history of the oil field we will be touring as well as the details of their project.

<summary>TPO52 Conversation 1</summary>

- ***NARRATOR***: Listen to a conversation between a student and his creative writing professor.

- ***FEMALE PROFESSOR***: John, listen, I can clearly see that you put a lot of time into your **response paper**...

- ***MALE STUDENT***: I did! It took me forever. I rewrote it **a dozen times**.

- ***FEMALE PROFESSOR***: And your hard work shows. Unfortunately…it's a week late.

- ***MALE STUDENT***: I know, sorry. I just got a little behind—y’know, sports and homework… But **I’m on top of things now**.

- ***FEMALE PROFESSOR***: Glad to hear it. Now, as for our meeting today… I like to talk to all of my creative writing students **one-on-one** at least once during the term and see how they’re doing.

- ***MALE STUDENT***: I think I'm doing OK. Busy, you know, but other than that…

- ***FEMALE PROFESSOR***: Well, I've found through the years that some of my assignments can be pretty tough for first year students like yourself. Like the response paper you just did—the explication of a Pablo Neruda poem. Uh, by the way, why did you choose “The Lemon”? It's an… unusual choice.

- ***MALE STUDENT***: It was my favorite in a book of Neruda’s poems. All the poems are about **everyday objects** and, y’know, simple pleasures.

- ***FEMALE PROFESSOR***: Right. **Elemental Odes**. One of my favorites.

- ***MALE STUDENT***: I liked how Neruda took things like fruit and vegetables and... socks... and used **metaphors and similes** to describe them as these wonderful, mysterious things. Like in “The Lemon,” he describes a lemon falling to Earth from the stars! And he compares **a slice of** lemon to a **stained-glass** window. It’s so original.

- ***FEMALE PROFESSOR***: Beautiful images, aren’t they? Neruda didn’t win the Nobel Prize for literature by accident.

- ***MALE STUDENT***: No, he didn't.

- ***FEMALE PROFESSOR***: Now, as you know, the paper was only the first half of the assignment… and I'm concerned about your ability to complete the second part on time considering how much time the first part took you.

- ***MALE STUDENT***: Actually,.. I finished it just before I came here.

- ***FEMALE PROFESSOR***: Excellent!

- ***MALE STUDENT***: It was **tricky**, too— you know, having to write a poem **inspired by** “The Lemon”—but in a completely different style.

- ***FEMALE PROFESSOR***: Right.

- ***MALE STUDENT***: In order to do that, I really had to study Neruda's style and read a lot of his stuff—which was great. But... “The Lemon” is free verse. So to do the assignment, I decided to use a strict meter—**iambic pentameter** —to be as different as possible.

- ***FEMALE PROFESSOR***: So each line of your poem has ten **syllables**, and every other syllable is stressed… Interesting choice. Iambic pentameter is certainly different from free verse!

- ***MALE STUDENT***: It was hard for me, though, because usually when I write a poem, I choose my own topic and—I just write, I don’t worry about counting syllables or anything. So... I'm **kinda** hoping we won’t have more assignments like this.

- ***FEMALE PROFESSOR***: Sorry to disappoint you, but these assignments are designed to get you out of your comfort zone…to get you reading and writing a wide variety of poetic styles.

<summary>TPO52 Conversation 2</summary>

***NARRATOR***: Listen to part of a conversation between a student and an employee at the campus store.

***FEMALE STUDENT***: I like those ceramic coffee mugs you have on display at the other end of the store. Were they made by students?

***MALE PROFESSOR***: Oh, we only use certain suppliers—wholesalers who've been selected by the store manager.

***FEMALE STUDENT***: Do you ever sell things made by students?

***MALE PROFESSOR***: We use preferred vendors only because, I mean… if we said yes to one student, we’d have to say yes to any student who asks. And the store's only so big!

***FEMALE STUDENT***: Hmm, that’s too bad, 'cause—um, I make these pretty ceramic bowls—I design 'em myself—I'm a studio art major. Anyway, I was hoping I could sell ’em here. Y’see, I’m taking Art 202 —“Marketing your Art.” And for my final project, I need to find a way to sell my own artwork.

***MALE PROFESSOR***: Hmm… What about selling online? A lotta art and crafts are marketed that way.

***FEMALE STUDENT***: I really don't have the computer skills, or the time to manage a Web site.

***MALE PROFESSOR***: What about the Emporium— y’know, that gift shop downtown? I’ve seen items by local artists there—

***FEMALE STUDENT***: The Emporium buys directly from artists?

***MALE PROFESSOR***: Well, they sell items on consignment.

***FEMALE STUDENT***: Consignment… I think my professor mentioned that.

***MALE PROFESSOR***: Yeah, you give them some items to sell on your behalf, and then you and the store split the purchase price. But they wouldn't pay you anything up front—if that’s what you want. And might may need to provide your own display case.

***FEMALE STUDENT***: Oh, I already have a display case, a portable one with three shelves. But aren't there shops that would, y'know, just buy stuff from me outright? Cause, if not enough bowls are sold, how would I recoup the cost of my materials—they’re not cheap… and neither was the case!

***MALE PROFESSOR***: All the stores around here that sell craft items are small and independently owned, like the Emporium.For them, selling on consignment lowers their risk; they don’t get stuck with unsold items—they can return them to the owner. You just have to make sure you set a retail price high enough to make it worth your while. But you're right, consignment isn't for everyone. What about the spring craft fair? Y’know, that outdoor market that’s held on Saturdays? Plenty of local people sell their stuff there—ceramics, jewelry, decorative items…The vendor fee is nominal, I believe.

***FEMALE STUDENT***: Oh yeah, I remember seeing that last year…all those tables lined up in that vacant lot on Main Street, right?

***MALE PROFESSOR***: Right! Since the craft fair's only a few blocks from campus, it seems like a good place for students to sell things.

***FEMALE STUDENT***: Do you know how it works?

***MALE PROFESSOR***: I think you'd just rent a space and set up a table to display your bowls on. You’d set the prices and keep all the profits.

***FEMALE STUDENT***: Seems doable—But, hmm… I don't have a car to haul everything down there.

***MALE PROFESSOR***: You could take the campus bus—it goes into town on weekends.

***FEMALE STUDENT***: True. But… I'd also hafta sit there all day when I should be in the library or the studio. I dunno… I suppose I could do my reading assignments between customers.

<summary>TPO52 Lecture 1</summary>

***NARRATOR***: Listen to part of a lecture in an art class.

***MALE PROFESSOR***: This week you're going to be starting something new…painting a still life. 

First I wanted to give you a little background…that might be helpful when you start working. We’ve spent a lot of time on portraits in this class, and moving from painting people to painting objects might feel like a big shift, but… I think it's important for you to understand that you can pack just as much life, and vibrancy, and excitement, into a painting of a bowl of fruit, as you can into something more dynamic. 

And you know, still lifes don't just need to be straightforward representations…. A lot of still-life painters really use the simplicity of the style to send a message, or—or tell a story. Even portraits sometimes include elements of still-life paintings; for example, in a portrait there might be a map hanging on the wall, or there might be some books on a table next to the subject. These objects tell you something about the subject, like, uh, maybe that person was well educated. 

A big part of still-life painting is the use of those kinds of symbols— the objects you include can provide more context and help convey your message. I’d also like to show everyone an example of still life, that we can talk about a little and…ah, and use—to get some inspiration. This is by James Peale, one of the true masters of the art of still life. This piece is called Still Life: Balsam Apple and Vegetables, and it's a really, really great example of what I’m going to be looking for in your painting. Now, Peale did his work in the early nineteenth century, and painters of that period approached still-life painting from a scientific perspective…. Let’s look at this painting to help you understand what I mean. 

See the red tomatoes in the foreground, and how vibrant that color is? And if you look at the large heads of cabbage farther back, every detail—every crinkle in each leaf, all the folds, are so precise, they're almost like a sketch you'd see in a field guide. Peale, and other painters of his era, used still-life painting as a way of, ah, of exploring the natural world, and satisfying their curiosity about nature. So now we can take some time to discuss a little more of, more about the…the actual process, of uh… still-life painting. Now, before you paint a single stroke, you've got to plan the composition of your painting— you know, the arrangement of the objects, to make sure everything is set up the way you want it. I remember a still-life piece I painted when I was at university.… It was vegetables, I think, and I had created sketches of the setting— but then realized that the arrangement of the vegetables in a basket just, ugh, just didn't look right… so I had to start over. So I can say from experience, it's really important to make sure your arrangement is just right before you even start painting. 

Now, what are some ways to make sure the composition of your painting is the way you want it to be? Well, it’s important in a still life to make sure you're not overdoing the amount of positive space—the amount of stuff, in your piece. A still life really is not just about the subject matter…. If you make a really cluttered composition with too much going on, it can throw off your painting. That's something you notice in the James Peale painting. Notice how it really, you know, it makes great use of negative space. You can see how he…sort of embraces those little empty spots on the table… and-and that adds a really nice sense of balance. 

Also—try to make your still life look natural— if it looks contrived, and if—if it's obvious a person deliberately arranged everything, it takes away from the simplicity and the natural feel of the work. Basically, the best still life paintings are the ones where the objects don’t look arranged for the painting at all, but that those tomatoes are near that cabbage on a table by accident.

<summary>TPO52 Lecture 2</summary>

***NARRATOR***: Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental science class.

***FEMALE PROFESSOR***: Today we're going to begin discussing ecosystems.

One important point I wanna emphasize from the reading is that there’re many interactions that take place within an ecosystem… interactions between animals, interactions between living and nonliving things, and so on.

Now these interactions can be fairly simple and straightforward. Ah, there are certain species of ants and rodents sharing a desert ecosystem in Arizona, and they compete for the same plant seeds… and the competition influences not only the size of the ant and rodent populations, but also the number of eventual plants.

Now this interaction is easy to see, right? However, there're many other interactions within ecosystems that are not so apparent and require closer examination. And the example from your reading was the forest ecosystem along the Pacific coast of North America…um… specifically the role of salmon. OK. As you probably know, salmon are born in freshwater streams, they migrate to oceans where they spend most of their lives, and then they return to the same streams where they were born to reproduce… or spawn.

In order to spawn, salmon need cold, clear streams to ensure the survival of their eggs… and trees in the surrounding forest play an important role here. Their leaves provide shade from the sun. When logging removes the trees, the streams are open to the sun and the water becomes warmer. When the water warms up, the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water decreases… and this reduces the chance that the salmon eggs will survive. And the trees also help keep the soil on the banks of the stream in place. Salmon cannot spawn in streambeds clogged with sediment—dirt— from the surrounding area… they need a clean gravel streambed. Brad?

***MALE STUDENT***: I've read that salmon also help keep streams healthy.

***FEMALE PROFESSOR***: Right. Salmon contribute important nutrients like carbon and phosphorous, and these nutrients promote diversity in the stream environment. OK. Um, so salmon need trees to successfully reproduce. But surprisingly, trees also need salmon… and bears play an important intermediary role. So in the autumn, bears are busy putting on extra weight as they prepare to hibernate. Each bear catches an estimated 700 fish during the 45 days that the salmon are spawning. The bears catch the salmon in the streams, and then they carry them back into the forest to eat… sometimes as much as 800 meters from the streams. And since the bears only eat about half of each fish they catch, other animals like eagles, crows, and insects feed on the leftovers. Maria?

***FEMALE STUDENT***: Why do the bears bring the salmon so far into the forest? Why not just eat the fish near the streams?

***FEMALE PROFESSOR***: Well, imagine several hungry bears looking for salmon. When one bear catches a fish, it's not uncommon for another bear to try stealing it. These confrontations can be pretty intense, so it's safer to bring it back into the forest… to a place where the bear can eat undisturbed.

***MALE STUDENT***: Um, you said that the bears only eat half of each fish they catch? I mean if I were a bear preparing to hibernate I'd probably eat everything I could catch.

***FEMALE PROFESSOR***: Well, certain parts of salmon are more nourishing… fattier than others. It's actually more efficient for a bear to only eat some parts of the fish, and then try catching another one, instead of eating the whole fish. OK. So after the scavengers have eaten the leftovers, only the fish's skeleton remains. Now salmon contain nitrogen, so their decomposing bodies and skeletons provide a lot of nitrogen to the surrounding forest. Plants absorb this nitrogen, which they need to grow, so the transfer of this nitrogen to the forests is important— forests near streams with salmon actually reach maturity faster than other forests. OK. So, why's all this important? Well, salmon are in trouble. Some of their populations have gone extinct, and most of the remaining populations have been significantly reduced by overfishing and environmental challenges. Now conservationists can try to prevent overfishing, but, well, I mean you can see the interconnections within this ecosystem. We already talked about the importance of trees to salmon, and the negative effect that something like logging can have. So you can see that protecting this ecosystem is going to take a broad effort.

<summary>TPO52 Lecture 3</summary>

***NARRATOR***: Listen to part of a lecture in a chemistry class.

***MALE PROFESSOR***: OK, so today we're going to talk about the Arctic, ozone depletion, and… snowflakes. And it’s all related! Let’s start with snowflakes. Now, I find snowflakes fascinating. To even begin to understand them, you need to understand physics, chemistry, and mathematics. Even though there's been a lot of research, there's still actually a lot about snowflakes that we don't understand yet— hard to believe, I know… Anyway, snowflakes have a particular form: there’s a six-sided center, with six branches or arms that radiate out from it. But how do they get that way? Well, you start with water vapor—you need a pretty humid atmosphere— and that water vapor condenses directly into ice, into an ice crystal. At this point it looks kind of like a thin dinner plate that, rather than being circular, is hexagonal, with six flat edges. It's at this point in the process where we begin to see why each snowflake is unique. Imagine this dinner plate is floating around in the wind, right, and when it encounters water vapor, molecules from that vapor attach to each of the six sides. You begin to see the development of six arms or branches radiating out from the center plate. Each time the snowflake encounters water vapor, more molecules attach to it, leading to more and more complex structures— and, of course, each snowflake takes a unique route through the clouds, on its way down… and so the quantity of water vapor it goes through is gonna be unique for each one.

Now, one important characteristic of snowflakes is that they have something called a quasi-liquid layer—the QLL. Our snowflake is an ice crystal, right? Well, we find a quasi-liquid layer on the surface of ice. It's basically a thin layer of water that's not completely frozen— and it exists at temperatures well below freezing, though the thickness varies at different temperatures. Now this quasi-liquid layer, it plays an important role in what we're going to talk about next…— uh, … yes, Mary?

***FEMALE STUDENT***: How can liquid exist below freezing? Why doesn't it freeze?

***MALE PROFESSOR***: Well… when water becomes ice, the molecules bond together and they get sort of, uh, locked into place. They can't move around as much anymore. So each molecule is surrounded by other molecules, and they're all locked together. But what about the exterior of the ice? There's a layer of water molecules on the surface… they're attached to molecules only on one side, so they're a bit freer… they can move around a bit more. Think of a, think of a… brick wall. Uh, the bricks in the wall, they have other bricks above and below them, and they're all locked against each other. But that top layer, it only has a layer below it. Now… this can only be taken so far… because of course, bricks don't move at all they’re not liquid. But if the bricks were water molecules, well, this top layer would be the quasi-liquid layer, and it wouldn't be completely frozen. Does that make sense? So finally, we get to the connection between snowflakes and ozone. Ozone is a gas found in the atmosphere of Earth.

Now, there's the ozone found in the stratosphere, which is the layer of the atmosphere from 6 to 30 miles above the Earth. This is considered “good” ozone, which occurs naturally and helps block harmful radiation from the Sun. But there is also ground-level ozone. It's exactly the same gas, but it's found closer to the surface of the Earth. This ground-level ozone results from human activities, and at high concentrations it can be a pollutant. Now, snowflakes' quasi-liquid layer plays an important role in some complex chemical reactions— we're going to be looking at these in detail later today. But basically, these reactions cause certain chemicals to be released, and these chemicals reduce the amount of ground-level ozone.

<summary>真题 Lecture 1</summary>

Listen to part of a lecture in a botany class.

In yesterday's class, we finished the chapter on outdoor **remediation** by watching a documentary about how large plots of mushrooms are being planted, who assist in cleaning up the land at old oil refinery sites. The mushrooms help clean up the pollution by absorbing the oil out of the soil, and then they are safely **discarded**.

Now let's switch our focus from the outdoor environment to the indoor environment.

In the United States, the first evidence we had that house plants can alter ***the quality of indoor air*** was documented and provided by the government's space program, NASA. See, NASA researchers were attempting to design environments for people to live in in outer space. Consequently, they built BIO home in the mid 1980s. BIO home was a small, tightly **sealed** living space constructed with synthetic materials. There was no **ventilation**.

***The problem was that it soon became apparent that people living in BIO home were having physical reactions to those materials, things like **wheezing** and coughing.***

Well, at one point, the NASA researchers decided to place quite a number of plants in BIO home. Sure enough, the inhabitants complaints cleared up. Could that have just been a coincidence? Not according to the prior research that NASA had done in their experiment, individual low light plants that they knew didn't require a lot of sunlight had each been placed in separate sealed glass containers.

Then a single isolated chemical was injected into each container. For example, from **aldehyde** was one of the chemicals selected since it's quite a common chemical. Or rather more precisely, I should say that **formaldehyde** is present in a lot of things in many un hunts, most noticeably in the first several months when products are new. Oh, like in what sort of things?

Well, let's see.

Um, just off the Top of my head, **plywood paneling**, uh, for liquor, kitchen cabinets, insulation over the list goes on. It's quite extensive. Now, as far as the experiment goes well, in glass containers that contained a plant, the different airborne chemicals that were used decreased and decreased substantially. However, in the glass chambers, with no plan, the chemical levels stayed the same. 

Are they all the same species of plant? Great question. The answer is no. And because of that, researchers noticed that certain varieties of plants were more effective than others at removing particular chemicals. And that's clearly supported by even more recent research.

For instance, one species of fern called the ***Boston firm*** has been found to be unusually effective in terms of target hitting formaldehyde. It's dramatically better at it than most other plants are.

So the leaves of the plants make this happen? Well, that's what you think, right? And the leaves do help to some extent.

But what most people don't know is that actually the majority of the purification process takes place near the roots of the plant.

See, it's the microorganisms that live around the roots of the plant at break down the chemicals. They are most responsible. They turn the chemicals into food for the plant. Each plant species has different kinds of microorganisms that thrive around its root base. I'm I'm curious, were there any negative effects for the plants in these situations? Did their effectiveness decrease after the **fed** sells had taken all this stuff in? Not at all.

Further research research done after that NASA study has revealed to us that plants ability to remove chemicals from the air actually improves overtime. It turns out the microorganisms actually adapt. They they increase in number to meet higher concentrations of chemical. So essentially, it's a win win situation for both the plant and the person.

Now, it's also interesting to note that over the year, the subsequent research, we've come to realize that the ***soil*** itself is actually something that can be taken out of the equation.

***As far as the microorganisms are concerned, the air purification process becomes most efficient if we use a mixture that's made up of only two ingredients, carbon pellets and rocks.*** Why? Well, the contaminated air can move more easily down to the root zone through the small gaps between the rocks. And that's really all you need.

<summary>真题 Lecture 2</summary>

Narrator:

Listen to part of a lecture in a film history class. The class has been studying early cinema.

Professor:

For the rest of today's class, we're going to talk about some of the earliest animated films. Animated films are, as you know, films that use a large number of photographs with the position of the characters and objects in each next photo being only slightly different than in the previous one. **When the photos are shown one by one in a rapid sequence, it creates the appearance of movement.** One of the **pioneers** of animated films was Lothar Reiniger. Reiniger was born in Germany in 1899. Her first full **length** film is the oldest surviving full length animated film in the history of cinema. A lot of people assume that American filmmaker **Walt Disney** was the first to make a full length animated film, but Reiniger's film was released a good ten years before Disney's. Disney's film was far more sophisticated, but Reiniger's came first. As a child, Reiniger loved shadow puppetry, an art form that originated in Asia over 2000 years ago. Anyone familiar with what a shadow puppet show looks like? Mary?

Female Student:

Yeah, my brother and I used to put them on for our parents and friends when we were kids. It was a lot of fun. I'm sure it.

Was. So, what did you do?

We got some **cardboard** and scissors, cut out little shapes of whatever characters we wanted to have in the show. People, animals, whatever. Those were the puppets.

Okay.

Then we'd **hang up** a bedsheet, our parents and friends being on one side of the sheet while our **cut up** cardboards and us, we were on the other side. Then we'd shine a light from behind our cardboard puppets and that would **cast** their shadows on the sheet. So that's what the audience on the other side would see. We'd make up simple stories and have the puppets shadows act them out on the screen.

Thank you. This should really clarify for the whole class how this type of theater works. Reiniger, when she was a child, also put on shadow puppet shows, and the way she'd later make her animated films was based to great extent on the simple technology of those shows. She'd **cut out** little characters, set her characters up in a scene, and light the scene from behind. Just like in her puppet shows. To make a movie, she'd take a photo of the scene, then she'd move the characters just a little. They had arms and legs and hands and so on that could move, and then she'd take another photo and so on. Thousands of photos.

Then she'd run all the photos together to create the **illusion of motion**. So that was all pretty traditional, not really new. But then there's also this other side of her. She thinks her photographs look one dimensional, without distinguishing which objects **are supposed to** be closer and which ones farther away. So in response, she comes up with this **multiplane** camera. She **takes a wooden table** and has a rectangle cut out of it. In that opening, she **stacks** three plates of glass on one plate. She sets up the foreground of the scene.

**On another plate**, she sets up the middle ground and on the last plate the background of the same scene. She then puts a light below the plates and a camera above the plates and takes a photograph. This setup enables her to create the illusion of depth in her films, and it becomes the **forerunner** for the more sophisticated method Walt Disney would use to film his first full length animation. So **in terms of** filmmaking technology, Reiniger was both heavily influenced by the past and quite innovative. The same **holds true** for her subject matter.

Almost all of her films were inspired by very old legends and fairy tales, but she **artfully** and **extensively** modified those stories to take full advantage of the new possibilities offered by the new medium. Okay, that's it for today. But before you go, as you already know from the **syllabus** in preparation for next class, you're going to be reading the traditional version of a fairy tale Reiniger made into a movie. Then next class, we'll watch the movie, discuss how Reiniger modified the tale, and **speculate** as to why she modified it that way. And if you haven't done the reading.

<summary>真题 Conversation 1</summary>

Narrator:

Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee in the **Audiovisual** Services office.

Student:

Hi, I'm Jeanine Simms.

Employee:

Yes. You called this morning?

Student:

Yeah. So, like I told you earlier, I work for the university's **alumni** magazine. You know, that gets sent out to all the former students.

Employee:

Sure. Actually, that magazine **gets delivered to** my house. I graduated from here four years ago.

Student:

Oh, cool. In that case, **do you mind if** I ask what you think about the magazine?

Employee:

Well, the truth is, when I first graduated, I would look through each edition. The point of the magazine seems to be to update people on what's going on at the university. But since I started working here a few years ago, well, **now I already know about campus updates**.

Student:

I see what you're saying. But you know, **now the campus updates are only part of the magazine.** Recently we started including more of **a range of content**. So now we also write **feature stories** on members of the university community who are doing interesting things. Like in the last issue, we wrote about a graduate who became an **astronaut**, and we provide information about the history of the university or about **faculty research**. I think you'd be pleasantly surprised by **the new approach** we're taking.

Employee:

Okay, you've convinced me to give it another look.

Student:

Great. So anyway, as I mentioned, I'm supposed to be taking photos of the new library for the magazine, but my camera isn't working properly. I have to bring it back to the shop for repairs.

Employee:

Well, we've got an available camera you can use. How long do you think you'll need it for?

Student:

Just a couple of days.

Employee:

No problem. So the new library

Student:

Yeah. Modern design, lots of open space. I think it's really beautiful.

Employee:

Are we talking about the same building?

Student:

I did hear that the design was a bit controversial.

Employee:

That's for sure.

Student:

Well, I'm studying architecture, so I get excited about this stuff.

Employee:

Well, there are plenty of interesting buildings on campus.

Student:

That was actually one of the biggest attractions for me when I chose to come to this university. I think it says a lot about the culture of a school when it's willing to take risks with its building designs.

Employee:

You know, there's a lecture coming up next week.

Student:

By Mary Albertson, the famous architect I know, but it's only open to graduate students and faculty.

Employee:

But they've asked me to record it. They want to make it available to everyone. I could send you the link to it.

Student:

Oh, that would be wonderful. Thanks.

Listen to part of a lecture in an animal behavior class.

So we've been talking about how animals use sound to attract mates, birds, frogs, **whales**.

They all **sing** to capture the **attention** of a potential mate.

Many insects also do this. And one of the insect world's most **accomplished** singers is the **cicada**.

Yeah.I want to focus on Australian cicadas today.

Now there are many species of cicada in Australia, but we'll be talking about some species in which both the males and females produce sounds in order to locate each other.

The males **amid** a **series** of clicks and **chirps**which serve to **alert** females to their presence and to identify them as members of a particular species.

When a female cicada, here's the song of a male of her species. She **responds** with a click that she makes by **flapping** her wings.

That sound is her way of alerting the mail that she is **of** the same species.

Now was very important here is when she responds, see the males songs have **brief pauses** in them, some of which the female needs to respond to.

And not only does she have to know which pauses to respond to the male also expects her to click at a very **precise** time.

The accuracy of her clicking helps the male recognize her as a member of his species.

Now remember that point, because this is where studying Australian cicadas gets very interesting.

See, the songs of the male cicadas keep **evolving**, keep changing.

But why did they want to keep changing the song? Wouldn't that just **confuse** the females?

Exactly? Why would a male cicada **risk** changing his song when the female's ability to follow **along** is so important?

A team of researchers thinks it has to do with another Australian insect, the **spotted** predatory **katydid**.

The katydid has a talent that researchers only recently discovered. They observed Katy **diss**, responding to male cicada songs.

The katydid is **imitation** of the female cicadas. Clicking response was not perfect,

but it was **accurate** enough to attract some males in close enough to eat, eat it.

We talked about **aggressive** mimicry a few weeks ago. Would this be an example?

Yes, yes, it would. Why don't you **remind** the class what aggressive mimicry is?

Well, it's when a predator attracts **prey** to it, by imitating something harmless or attractive, sometimes even imitating the prey itself. Yes.

So as you suggest, the same kind of thing is happening here.The katydid **subtract** their prey with sound.

This **acoustic** aggressive mimicry is, well, there's only one other **instance** of it.

There's a species of big cat in south America that can imitate some sounds made by the monkey's.

It likes to eat. Okay, back to the cicadas and **Katy diss**.

Now a female cicada knows one song, the song of her species.

But it turns out Katy diss have generally figured out cicada songs well enough to be able to click along to the songs of several different species of cicadas.

The researchers played **recordings** of the songs of 26 different species of cicadas to captive Katy **deeds**.

And some of those species of cicadas do not live in Australia, so the katydid couldn't possibly have **heard** them before.

And for most of those songs, Katy **dismayed**. They're clicking noises **during** the pauses, in the mail songs.

So what is going on? Well, as I said, a male cicada song can have several brief pauses in it.

Most of these pauses tell the female when to click her wings.

But the katydid is click at all the pauses for just about every cicada song they hear, **regardless** of the species, which can be enough to get a male cicada close enough for the katydid is **purposes**.

Now remember when I said that the songs of some species of cicadas keep changing, the researchers think it's to fool the katydids.

But wait, if the katydid can respond to songs they've never even heard before,

does it matter whether the cicada changes it song?

Well, apparently it does. Because in these new songs are new posits. Some of those ones where female cicadas don't click that katydid do.

So if a male cicada, here's a click where there shouldn't be one. He knows it's not a female cicada responding.

However, all the female cicadas know not to click at these new pauses. Well, that's not clear to researchers yet.

So it'll be interesting to see what more studies show.

Listen to a conversation between a student and her **anatomy** professor.

Hi, Jane. Your email said you're going to the museum on your own.

Yeah, sorry, but I work in the coffee shop on Friday. I can't get the time off, so I can't go tomorrow with our class. So I'm going this afternoon instead.

The Richmond museum has one of the best medical collections around.

But you know the exhibits are so fascinating that, well, the students get **caught up** in looking at things.

And most things there are unrelated to what we're studying.

I've looked at the **ribbon** collection online and see how that could happen.

That's why I wanted to talk to you before **you go**. I always ask my students to pay close attention to the three dimensional models.

They have models of all the major human **organs** and to be able to hold a model and study it closely.

Okay? Pay special attention to the model of the **lungs**. It'll reinforce everything we've been discussing about the **respiratory** system.

I'll need all the **reinforcement** I can get. I didn't do as well on the last **quiz**. As I thought I would. I was really surprised when I saw my score.

I thought you'd do better, too.

Was it the question about **lungs** and the exchange of **gas**?

I mean I know there are two parts to the respiratory system, the zone that brings air into the lungs and the zone where there is an exchange of gases.

Yes, so you understand how the lungs work, but the zone that brings air into and out of the lungs is called the **conducting** zone, and then where gases are exchanged is called the respiratory zone.

You mixed up those two terms on the quiz.

I know I'm so **bummed** the conducting zone and the respiratory zone.

Now, a mistake, many of your classmates made, they forgot there are parts of the conducting zone that lie outside the lungs.

The **diaphragm** beneath the lungs is part of the conducting zone, so is the nose.

Right, and there are structures within the lungs that aren't involved in the exchange of gases.

True. You do seem to understand the process as well, though.

There's no reason to worry, go over the terms in chapter 18, and you'll be in great shape for the final exam.

And let me know if the models at the **rigman** were helpful for you.

If you did the reading assignment, then what an **invasive species** is, right?

It's a species, either a plant or **an animal** species that's not **native to the ecosystem that it's living in**, and that's likely to harm the health of native species.


Your book focused on how **invasive** plants **affect** native species of plants.

So I **thought** we could talk a little about a specific invasive species, Canada thistle, Canada thistle, **despite** its name, comes from Europe.

It has **invaded** a significant area of land in the northwestern part of the United States that includes Yellowstone, national park.

And like all invasive plants, Canada thistle uses up resources that native plants need to survive.

So It **squeezes out** those plant species, and it's really, very difficult to **get rid of** because it has such an **extensive** root system.

Its roots are so deep that it's difficult to kill with any **sort** of chemical spread. Yes, Steven.

I'm just wondering is that what makes Canada thistle unusual like special somehow and it's hard to **get rid of.**

I mean，the book **gave** examples of lots of **weeds** that are invasive and

No，no, I mention it because it's important to remember that all invasive species don't affect all native species species in an area in the same way.

And invasive species themselves are affected by different environmental conditions. Oh, Okay.

Like one of the things that makes this an interesting example is that very different **factors** have contributed to helping it **spread over** such a large area, like climate change.

One researcher at Yellowstone National Park **estimated** that the amount of soil **hospitable** to thistles **doubled** in that park over the **past 20 or so** years.

Because of climate change areas **that were** once wet and **marshy** have **dried out**, which has made them fertile **ground** for Canada thistle.

A very different factor is a **mutually** beneficial relationship that Canada thistle has with the native **pocket gopher**, which **eats** its roots. Jenny,

how is it beneficial for the thistle to **get eaten**

Well, in the process of **getting to** the thistle? The gophers help **spread it**. They spend a great deal of time **tunneling** underground.

And when they do that, they **churn** the soil, and this makes the soil more suitable for thistle growth.

So you have a **cycle**. More **churned** soil means more Canada thistle, and more thistle means more food for gophers, which leads to an increase in the gopher population.

And in fact, the thistle has benefited more than one **native** animal species. Besides the gopher. It also provides food for the **grizzly** bear.

Grizzly bears eat it. Yes, grizzlies are **adaptive foragers**. They can eat just about anything from small **insects** to plant roots to large animals.

So when one of its **staple** foods, white **pine nuts** began to **decline**, the grizzlies didn't suffer because they were adaptive and could start eating more Canada thistles.

Of course, not all species are so lucky.

For example, another animal in the same ecosystem is the long tailed weasel, which isn't adaptive.

It specializes in one main food **source**, and it suffers when that food supply declines.

So since if he's **primarily on voles**, they're like **mice** and vole populations are also **declining** in Yellowstone.

The weasel population is probably going to decline too. Since it can't easily acquire the **nourishment**, it needs from another food source.

So you can see from the example of Canada, thistle and an **invasive** species can significantly affect an entire ecosystem.

In fact, you could say that invasive species are the single greatest **threat** to biological diversity.

Because in addition to their effect on native animals, they can **lead to the disappearance** of many plant species.

So can anything be done about this thistle? Like I said before, chemicals don't seem **promising**.

There are other methods, but they're far from perfect. One is to introduce into the environment, **insects** that eat it.

Another possibility is to introduce new species of plants that can **compete** with it for resources, something that could **limit the whistles growth**.

But honestly, some of these we just shouldn't try. I don't think. Why look for trouble by **introducing additional** species to an **already struggling** ecosystem.

**Graduation speaker should be a business leader**  
 

I think the university should invite a business leader to speak at this year's graduation ceremony - perhaps an executive from one of the large corporations in the area. For students, business leaders are excellent role models because they represent the meaning of professional success. They influence people every day, make important decisions, and have achieved impressive salaries. Furthermore, inviting a business executive will help reinforce to the community that our business program is the biggest and best one in the state. Prospective students will read about the speech and will remember that our university has a strong and attractive business program.

I prefer to save the extra money because it can benefit me a lot. 

First, although I can’t afford the things I want to get now, I can buy them after saving. For example, I wanted to buy an iPad during high school, so I saved extra money so that I could buy it at the university. Absolutely, if I didn’t save money, I would never get it. 

Plus, we can manage our money better by saving the extra money. Because of the effort I made to save money, I learned how to buy cheaper stuff and started to walk more instead of taking taxi, actually, it was helpful to my health, too. 

In conclusion, I indeed support saving extra money.

##### 题目还原
> Some people say that childhood is the best time in a person's life. Other people disagree. What is your opinion? Explain why.
###### My Answer
In my opinion, childhood is indeed the best period of time in one's life. 

On the one hand, children have less anxiety, so they can enjoy their spare time. 

On the other hand, kids don’t need to think about complicated things, such as how to make money or how to get a better job.

In conclusion, I think childhood is indeed the best period of time in one's life. 

(68words)
###### Polished Answer
I strongly believe childhood is the best time in life. 

First, children have fewer responsibilities, which allows them to fully enjoy simple joys like sharing candies. For example, they spend afternoons playing games with friends instead of preparing for meetings. I still remember spending summer afternoons sharing ice cream with my cousin – we never worried about things like saving money or job interviews. 

Plus, the world feels safer for children. Actually, my biggest childhood "problem" was choosing between cartoon channels, while now I stress about college applications.

That's why childhood, full of fun and freedom, is the golden chapter for most people.

<summary>TPO1 Groundwater</summary>

Groundwater is the word used to describe water that saturates the ground, filling all the available spaces. By far the most abundant type of groundwater is **meteoric** water; this is the groundwater that circulates as part of the water cycle. Ordinary meteoric water is water that has soaked into the ground from the surface, from **precipitation** (rain and snow) and from lakes and streams. There it remains, sometimes for long periods, before emerging at the surface again. <u>At first thought it seems incredible that there can be enough space in the "solid" ground underfoot to hold all this water.</u>

The necessary space is there, however, in many forms.  <u>The commonest spaces are those among the particles—sand **grains** and tiny pebbles—of loose, unconsolidated sand and **gravel**.</u> Beds of this material, out of sight beneath the **soil**, are common. They are found wherever fast rivers carrying loads of coarse **sediment** [1] once flowed. For example, as the great ice **sheets** that covered North America during the last ice age **steadily** melted away, huge volumes of water flowed from them. <u>The water was always **laden** with pebbles, gravel, and sand, known as glacial **outwash**, that was deposited as the flow slowed down.</u>

The same thing happens to this day, though on a smaller scale, wherever a sediment-laden river or stream emerges from a mountain valley onto relatively **flat** land, dropping its load as the current slows: the water usually spreads out **fanwise**, depositing the sediment in the form of a smooth, fan-shaped slope. Sediments are also dropped where a river slows on entering a lake or the sea; <u>the deposited sediments are on a lake floor or the seafloor at first, but will be located inland at some future date</u>, when the sea level falls or the land rises; such beds are sometimes thousands of meters **thick**.

In lowland country almost any **spot** on the ground may overlie what was once the bed of a river that has since become buried by soil; if they are now below the water’s upper surface (the water table), the gravels and sands of the former riverbed, and its **sandbars**, will be saturated with groundwater.

<u>So much for unconsolidated sediments. </u>Consolidated (or cemented) sediments, too, contain millions of minute water-holding **pores**. This is because the gaps among the original grains are often not totally **plugged** with **cementing** chemicals; also, parts of the original grains may become dissolved by **percolating** groundwater, either while consolidation is taking place or at any time afterwards. The result is that sandstone, for example, can be as **porous** as the loose sand from which it was formed.

Thus a proportion of the total volume of any sediment, loose or cemented, consists of empty space. Most **crystalline** rocks are much more solid; a common exception is **basalt**, a form of solidified volcanic **lava**, which is sometimes full of tiny bubbles that make it very porous.

<u>The proportion of empty space in a rock is known as its **porosity**. But note that porosity is not the same as **permeability**, which measures the ease with which water can flow through a material</u>; this depends on the sizes of the individual cavities and the **crevices** linking them.

Much of the water in a sample of water-saturated sediment or rock will drain from it if the sample is put in a suitable dry place. ■ But some will remain, clinging to all solid surfaces. ■ It is held there by the **force** of surface tension [2] without which water would drain instantly from any wet surface, leaving it totally dry. ■ The total volume of water in the saturated sample must therefore be thought of as consisting of water that can, and water that cannot, in away. ■  **What, then, determines what proportion of the water stays and what proportion drains away?**

The relative amount of these two kinds of water varies greatly from one kind of rock or sediment to another, even though their porosities may be the same. What happens depends on pore size. <u>If the pores are large, the water in them will exist as drops too heavy for surface tension to hold, and it will drain away; but if the pores are small enough, the water in them will exist as thin films, too light to overcome the force of surface tension holding them in place: then the water will be firmly held.</u>

###### 简化题
- A．岩石表面的张力不够大，无法将水分保留在岩石稍大点的孔隙中，但这种张力足以将水分保留在岩石较小的孔隙中。 
- B．岩石通过大的孔隙储存水分，水分会因为岩石表面张力的原因从小孔隙中遗失。 
- C．岩石中的水分以较大的水滴存在还是以很薄的水膜的形式存在，取决于岩石的表面张力，岩石的大小孔隙与这种张力相互影响。 
- D．倘若岩石表面张力太弱将导致其无法将水滴吸附在其表面，那么当岩石拥有大孔隙的时候，水分会继续残留在该处并形成一个薄膜。  
  - 阴影部分的句子可理解为：”如果孔隙很大，孔隙中的水会形成水滴，因重力原因克服吸引它的表面张力而掉落。但如果孔隙太小，孔隙中的水会像薄膜一样，由于过轻而无法克服吸引它的表面张力，从而被稳固的吸附在其中。”
  - A选项与原句意思相同；通过对选项的理解可以得出B选项C选项以及D选项都偏离了原句的意思。因此A选项正确。
  - 另外，根据原句中的分号和分号后面的”but”可以判断出原句逻辑关系为转折，四个选项中仅A选项表转折，因此A选项正确。
###### 插入题
- 第一个方块前后两句联系紧密（注意but这样的转折词）；
- 第二个方块后的it指代的是前面的water，插入句子后会改变指代关系；
- 第三个方块前后联句联系紧密（注意therefore这样的连接词）；
- 第四个方块正确，方块前面有drain away提示我们这个地方可以考虑。
  - 同样我们可以适当地联系下一段的内容，第九段说两种水的相对含量因岩石与沉积物种类不同而改变，为第八段所提出的问题做出了回答，而第八段中并没有对于插入句所提出问题的回答的内容，因此最恰当的插入位置应该是段末。因此插入到第四个方块正确。

- D.在露出地面之前，地下水通常都是长时间存在于地下 
- E.玄武岩和砂石一样，是多孔的结晶岩 
- F.松散的沉积层通常在内陆地区，这些内陆地区也曾在水下
  - 选项D的内容出现在文章第一段”地下水有时候会滞留在地下”，文中内容说的是”sometimes”会长时间的留在地下，而选项之中所说内容为”often”，这两者之间显然存在时间概念上的差别；本篇文章的讨论重点是地下水的形成与储存形式，至于groundwater在底下停留的时间，则完全不是文章的主要内容，而文章内容小结题要求选出文章最重要的内容，并非提到了就是正确选项。 
  - 选项E讨论了两个过于细微的概念”sandstone”和”basalt”，而显然，本文关注的对象应该是”groundwater”——两种岩石的具体名字显然是文章之中过于细微的概念，因此甚至不必回到原文去核对，直接判定该选项错误。
  - 选项F讨论对象是松散的沉积层——这个选项甚至没有讲到他与地下水之间的关系，因此，这个选项必定不是正确选项。 此题正确答案为A.B.C选项。

<summary>TPO1 The Origins of Theater</summary>

<u>In seeking to describe the origins of theater, one must rely primarily on speculation, since there is little concrete evidence on which to draw. </u>The most widely accepted theory, **championed** by **anthropologists** in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, envisions theater as emerging out of myth and **ritual**. The process **perceived** by these anthropologists may be summarized briefly. During the early stages of its development, a society becomes aware of **forces** that appear to influence or control its food supply and **well-being**. Having little understanding of natural causes, it <u>**attributes**</u> both desirable and undesirable occurrences to **supernatural** or magical forces, and it searches for means to win the favor of these forces. **Perceiving** an **apparent** connection between certain actions performed by the group and the result it desires, the group repeats, refines, and **formalizes** those actions into fixed ceremonies, or rituals.

Stories (myths) may then grow up around a ritual. Frequently the myths include representatives of those **supernatural** forces that the rites celebrate or hope to influence. Performers may wear costumes and masks to represent the mythical characters or supernatural forces in the rituals or in accompanying celebrations.<u> As a people becomes more sophisticated, its conceptions of supernatural forces and causal relationships may change. </u>As a result, it may abandon or modify some **rites**. But the myths that have grown up around the rites may continue as part of the group’s oral tradition and may even come to be acted out under conditions **divorced** from these rites. When this occurs, the first step has been taken toward theater as an **autonomous** activity, and thereafter entertainment and aesthetic values may gradually replace the former mystical and socially **efficacious** concerns.

■ Although origin in ritual has long been the most popular, it is by no means the only theory about how the theater came into being. ■ Storytelling has been proposed as one alternative. ■ Under this theory, relating and listening to stories are seen as fundamental human pleasures. ■ **To enhance their listeners’ enjoyment, storytellers continually make their stories more engaging and memorable.**Thus, the recalling of an event (a hunt, battle, or other **feat**) is **elaborated** through the **narrator**’s **pantomime** and **impersonation** and eventually through each role being **assumed** by a different person.

A closely related theory sees theater as evolving out of dances that are primarily **pantomimic**, rhythmical or **gymnastic**, or from imitations of animal noises and sounds. Admiration for the performer’s skill, **virtuosity**, and **grace** are seen as motivation for **elaborating** the activities into fully realized **theatrical** performances.

In addition to exploring the possible antecedents of theater, scholars have also theorized about the motives that led people to develop theater. Why did theater develop, and why was it valued after it ceased to fulfill the function of ritual? Most answers **fall back** on the theories about the human mind and basic human needs. One, **set forth by** Aristotle in the fourth century B.C., <u>sees humans as naturally imitative</u>—as taking pleasure in imitating persons, things, and actions and in seeing such imitations. Another, advanced in the twentieth century, suggests that <u>humans have a gift for fantasy</u>, through which they seek to reshape reality into more satisfying forms than those encountered in daily life. Thus, <u>fantasy or fiction (of which drama is one form) permits people to objectify their anxieties and fears, confront them</u>, and fulfill their hopes in fiction if not fact. The theater, then, is one tool whereby people define and world or escape from unpleasant realities.

But neither the human imitative instinct nor a **penchant** for fantasy by itself leads to an autonomous theater. Therefore, additional explanations are needed. One necessary condition seems to be a somewhat **detached** view of human problems. For example, one sign of this condition is the appearance of the comic vision, since comedy requires sufficient **detachment** to view some **deviations** from social norms as ridiculous rather than as serious threats to the welfare of the entire group. Another condition that contributes to the development of autonomous theater is the emergence of the aesthetic sense.  <u>For example, some early societies ceased to consider certain rites essential to their well-being and abandoned them; nevertheless, they retained as parts of their oral tradition the myths that had grown up around the rites and admired them for their artistic qualities rather than for their religious usefulness. </u>

<summary>TPO50 American Railroads</summary>

In the United States, railroads **spearheaded** the second phase of the transportation revolution by overtaking the previous importance of canals. The mid-1800s saw a great expansion of American railroads. The major cities east of the Mississippi River were linked by a spiderweb of railroad tracks. Chicago's growth illustrates the impact of these rail links. In 1849 Chicago was a village of a few hundred people with virtually no rail service. By 1860 it had become a city of 100,000, served by eleven railroads. Farmers to the north and west of Chicago no longer had to ship their grain, livestock, and dairy products down the Mississippi River to New Orleans; they could now ship their products directly east. Chicago **supplanted** New Orleans as the **interior** of America's main commercial hub.

The east-west rail lines stimulated the settlement and agricultural development of the Midwest. By 1860 Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin had replaced Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York as the leading wheat-growing states. Enabling farmers to speed their products to the East, railroads increased the value of farmland and promoted additional settlement. In turn, population growth in agricultural areas triggered industrial development in cities such as Chicago, Davenport (Iowa), and Minneapolis, for the new settlers needed lumber for fences and houses and mills to grind wheat into flour.

Railroads also **propelled** the growth of small towns along their routes. The Illinois Central Railroad, which had more track than any other railroad in 1855, made money not only from its traffic but also from real **estate** speculation. Purchasing land for stations along its path, the Illinois Central then **laid out** towns around the stations. The selection of Manteno, Illinois, as a stop of the Illinois Central, for example, transformed the site from a crossroads without a single house in 1854 into a **bustling** town of nearly a thousand in 1860, **replete** with hotels, lumberyards, grain elevators, and **gristmills**. By the **Civil War** (1861-1865), few thought of the railroad-linked Midwest as a frontier region or viewed its inhabitants as pioneers.

As the nation's first big business, the railroads transformed the conduct of business. During the early 1830s, railroads, like canals, depended on financial aid from state governments. With the **onset** of economic depression in the late 1830s, however, state governments **scrapped** overly ambitious railroad projects. Convinced that railroads burdened them with high taxes and **blasted** hopes, voters turned against state aid, and in the early 1840s, several states amended their constitutions to bar state funding for railroads and canals. The federal government took up some of the slack, but federal aid did not provide a major stimulus to railroads before 1860. Rather, part of the burden of finance passed to city and county governments in agricultural areas that wanted to attract railroads. Such **municipal** governments, for example, often gave railroads **rights-of-way**, grants of land for stations, and public funds.

The dramatic expansion of the railroad network in the 1850s, however, strained the financing capacity of local governments and required a turn toward private investment, which had never been absent from the picture. Well aware of the economic benefits of railroads, individuals living near them had long purchased railroad **stock** issued by governments and had directly bought stock in railroads, often paying by contributing their labor to building the railroads. But the large railroads of the 1850s needed more capital than such small investors could generate. Gradually, the center of railroad financing shifted to New York City, and in fact, it was the railroad boom of the 1850s that helped make Wall Street in New York City the nation's greatest capital market. The stocks of all the leading railroads were traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during the 1850s. In addition, the growth of railroads turned New York City into the center of modern investment firms. The investment firms evaluated the stock of railroads in the smaller American cities and then found purchasers for these stocks in New York City, Philadelphia, Paris, London, Amsterdam, and Hamburg. Controlling the flow of funds to railroads, the investment bankers began to exert influence over the railroads' internal affairs by supervising administrative reorganizations in times of trouble.

In contrast to the political **anarchy**, economic dislocation, and military destruction in Spanish America, Brazil's drive toward independence from Portugal proceeded as a relatively bloodless transition between 1808 and 1822. The idea of Brazilian independence first arose in the late eighteenth century as a Brazilian reaction to the Portuguese policy of tightening political and economic control over the colony in the interests of the mother country. The first significant conspiracy against Portuguese rule was organized from 1788-1799 in the province of Minas Gerais, where rigid governmental control over the production and prices of gold and diamonds, as well as heavy taxes, caused much **discontent**. But this conspiracy never went beyond the stage of discussion and was easily discovered and crushed. Other conspiracies in the late eighteenth century as well as a brief **revolt** in 1817 reflected the influence of republican ideas over sections of the elite and even the lower **strata** of urban society. All proved **abortive** or were soon crushed. Were it not for an accident of European history, the independence of Brazil might have been long delayed.

The French invasion of Portugal in 1807 followed by the flight of the Portuguese court (sovereign and government officers) to Rio de Janeiro brought large benefits to Brazil. Indeed, the transfer of the court in effect signified achievement of Brazilian independence. The Portuguese prince and future King Joao VI opened Brazil's ports to the trade of friendly nations, permitted the rise of local industries, and founded the Bank of Brazil. In 1815 he elevated Brazil to the legal status of a kingdom **coequal** with Portugal. **ln one sense**, however, Brazil's new status signified the substitution of one dependence for another. Freed from Portuguese control, Brazil came under the economic dominance of England, which obtained major **tariff concessions** and other privileges by the Strangford Treaty of 1810 between Portugal and Great Britain. The treaty provided for the importation of British manufactures into Brazil and the export of Brazilian agricultural produce to Great Britain. One result was an influx of cheap machine-made goods that **swamped** the handicrafts industry of the country.

Brazilian elites took satisfaction in Brazil's new role and the growth of educational, cultural, and economic opportunities for their class. But the feeling was mixed with resentment toward the thousands of Portuguese courtiers (officials) and **hangers-on** who came with the court and who competed with Brazilians for jobs and favors. Thus, the change in the status of Brazil sharpened the conflict between Portuguese elites born in Brazil and elites born in Portugal and loyal to the Portuguese crown.

The event that **precipitated** the break with the mother country was the revolution of 1820 in Portugal. The Portuguese **revolutionaries** framed a liberal constitution for the kingdom, but they were **conservative** or **reactionary** in relation to Brazil. They **demanded** the immediate return of King Joao to Lisbon, an end to the system of dual **monarchy** that he had **devised**, and the **restoration** of the Portuguese commercial monopoly. **Timid** and **vacillating**, King Joao did not know which way to turn. Under the pressure of his **courtiers**, who hungered to return to Portugal and their lost **estates**, he finally approved the new constitution and sailed for Portugal. He left behind him, however, his son and heir, Pedro, and in a private letter advised him that in the event the Brazilians should demand independence, he should **assume** leadership of the movement and set the crown of Brazil on his head.

Soon it became clear that the Portuguese **parliament** intended to set the clock back by **abrogating** all the **liberties** and **concessions** won by Brazil since 1808. One of its **decrees** insisted on the immediate return of Pedro from Brazil. The pace of events moved more rapidly in 1822. On January 9, urged on by Brazilian advisers who perceived a golden opportunity to make an orderly transition to independence without the intervention of the **masses**, Pedro refused an order from the parliament to return to Portugal, saying famously, "l remain." On September 7, regarded by all Brazilians as Independence Day, he issued the even more celebrated **proclamation**, "Independence or death!" In December 1822, having overcome slight resistance by Portuguese **troops**, Dom Pedro was formally proclaimed constitutional Emperor of Brazil.

<summary> TPO51 Memphis: United Egypt's First Capital</summary>

The city of Memphis, located on the Nile near the modern city of Cairo, was founded around 3100 B.C. as the first capital of a recently united Egypt. The choice of Memphis by Egypt's first kings reflects the site's strategic importance. First, and most obvious, the apex of the Nile River delta was a politically **opportune** location for the state's administrative center, standing between the united lands of Upper and Lower Egypt and offering ready access to both parts of the country. The older predynastic (pre-3100 B.C.) centers of power, This and Hierakonpolis, were too remote from the vast **expanse** of the delta, which had been incorporated into the unified state. Only a city within easy reach of both the Nile valley to the south and the more spread out, difficult terrain to the north could provide the necessary political control that the rulers of early dynastic Egypt (roughly 3000-2600 B.C.) required.

The region of Memphis must have also served as an important node for transport and communications, even before the unification of Egypt. The region probably acted as a **conduit** for much, if not all, of the river-based trade between northern and southern Egypt. Moreover, commodities (such as wine, precious oils, and metals) imported from the Near East by the royal courts of predynastic Upper Egypt would have been channeled through the Memphis region on their way south. In short, therefore, the site of Memphis offered the rulers of the Early Dynastic Period an ideal location for controlling internal trade within their realm, an essential requirement for a state-directed economy that depended on the movement of goods.

Equally important for the national administration was the ability to control communications within Egypt. The Nile provided the easiest and quickest artery of communication and the national capital was, again, ideally located in this respect. Recent geological surveys of the Memphis region have revealed much about its topography in ancient times. It appears that the location of Memphis may have been even more advantageous for controlling trade, transport, and communications than was previously appreciated. Surveys and drill cores have shown that the level of the Nile floodplain has steadily risen over the last five millenniums. When the floodplain was much lower, as it would have been in predynastic and early dynastic times, the outwash fans (fan-shaped deposits of sediments) of various **wadis** (stream-beds or channels that carry water only during rainy periods) would have been much more prominent features on the east bank. The fan associated with the Wadi Hof extended a significant way into the Nile floodplain, forming a constriction in the vicinity of Memphis. The valley may have narrowed at this point to a mere three kilometers, making it the ideal place for controlling river traffic.

Furthermore, the Memphis region seems to have been favorably located for the control not only of river-based trade but also of desert trade routes. The two outwash fans in the area gave access to the extensive wadi systems of the eastern desert. In predynastic times, the Wadi Digla may have served as a trade route between the Memphis region and the Near East, to judge from the unusual concentration of foreign artifacts found in the predynastic settlement of Maadi. Access to, and control of, trade routes between Egypt and the Near East seems to have been a **preoccupation** of Egypt’s rulers during the period of state formation. The desire to monopolize foreign trade may have been one of the primary factors behind the political unification of Egypt. The foundation of the national capital at the junction of an important trade route with the Nile valley is not likely to have been accidental. Moreover, the Wadis Hof and Digla provided the Memphis region with accessible desert **pasturage**. As was the case with the cities of Hierakonpolis and Elkab, the combination within the same area of both desert pasturage and **alluvial** arable land (land suitable for growing crops) was a particularly attractive one for early settlement; this combination no doubt contributed to the **prosperity** of the Memphis region from early predynastic times.

<summary>TPO51 Surface Fluids on Venus and Earth</summary>

A **fluid** is a substance, such as a liquid or gas, in which the component particles (usually molecules) can move past one another. Fluids flow easily and conform to the shape of their containers. The geologic processes related to the movement of fluids on a planet's surface can completely resurface a planet many times. These processes derive their energy from the Sun and the gravitational forces of the planet itself. As these fluids interact with surface materials, they move particles about or react chemically with them to modify or produce materials. On a solid planet with a **hydrosphere** and an atmosphere, only a tiny fraction of the planetary mass flows as surface fluids. Yet the movements of these fluids can drastically alter a planet. Consider Venus and Earth, both **terrestrial** planets with atmospheres.

Venus and Earth are commonly regarded as twin planets but not identical twins. They are about the same size, are composed of roughly the same mix of materials, and may have been comparably endowed at their beginning with carbon dioxide and water. However, the twins evolved differently largely because of differences in their distance from the Sun. With a significant amount of internal heat, Venus may continue to be geologically active with volcanoes, **rifting**, and folding. However, it lacks any sign of a hydrologic system (water circulation and distribution): there are no streams, lakes oceans or glaciers. Space **probes** suggest that Venus may have started with as much water as Earth, but it was unable to keep its water in liquid form. Because Venus receives more heat from the Sun, water released from the interior evaporated and rose to the upper atmosphere where the Sun's ultraviolet rays broke the molecules apart. Much of the freed hydrogen escaped into space, and Venus lost its water. Without water, Venus became less and less like Earth and kept an atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide acts as a blanket, creating an intense greenhouse effect and driving surface temperatures high enough to melt **lead** and to prohibit the formation of carbonate minerals. Volcanoes continually vented more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. On Earth, liquid water removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and combines it with calcium, from rock weathering, to form carbonate sedimentary rocks. Without liquid water to remove carbon from the atmosphere, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of Venus remains high.

Like Venus, Earth is large enough to be geologically active and for its gravitational field to hold an atmosphere. Unlike Venus, it is just the right distance from the Sun so that temperature ranges allow water to exist as a liquid, a solid, and a gas. Water is thus extremely mobile and moves rapidly over the planet in a continuous hydrologic cycle. Heated by the Sun, the water moves in great cycles from the oceans to the atmosphere, over the landscape in river systems, and ultimatelyback to the oceans. As a result, Earth's surface has been continually changed and eroded into delicate systems of river valleys - a remarkable contrast to the surfaces of other planetary bodies where impact craters dominate. Few areas on Earth have been untouched by flowing water. As a result, river valleys are the dominant feature of its landscape. Similarly, wind action has **scoured** fine particles away from large areas, depositing them elsewhere as vast sand seas dominated by **dunes** or in **sheets** of **loess** (fine-grained soil deposits). These fluid movements are caused by gravity flow systems energized by heat from the Sun. Other geologic changes occur when the gases in the atmosphere or water react with rocks at the surface to form new chemical compounds with different properties. An important example of this process was the removal of most of Earths carbon dioxide from its atmosphere to form carbonate rocks. However, if Earth were a little closer to the Sun, its oceans would evaporate; if it were farther from the Sun, the oceans would freeze solid. Because liquid water was present, self-replicating molecules of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen developed life early in Earth's history and have radically modified its surface, blanketing huge parts of the continents with greenery. Life thrives on this planet, and it helped create the planet's oxygen- and nitrogen-rich atmosphere and moderate temperatures.

<summary>TPO52 Stream Deposit</summary>

A large, swift stream or river can carry all sizes of particles, from clay to boulders. When the current slows down, its competence (how much it can carry) decreases and the stream deposits the largest particles in the streambed. If current velocity continues to decrease - as a **flood wanes**, for example - finer particles **settle out** on top of the large ones. Thus, a stream sorts its sediment according to size. A waning flood might deposit a layer of gravel, **overlain** by sand and finally topped by **silt** and clay. Streams also sort sediment in the downstream direction. Many mountain streams are choked with boulders and **cobbles**, but far downstream, their deltas are composed mainly of fine silt and clay. This downstream sorting is curious because stream velocity generally increases in the downstream direction. Competence increases with velocity, so a river should be able to transport larger particles than its **tributaries** carry. One explanation for downstream sorting is that abrasion wears away the boulders and cobbles to sand and silt as the sediment moves downstream over the years. Thus, only the fine sediment reaches the lower parts of most rivers.

A stream deposits its sediment in three environments: **Alluvial** fans and deltas form where stream **gradient** (angle of incline) suddenly decreases as a stream enters a flat plain, a lake, or the sea; floodplain deposits accumulate on a floodplain adjacent to the stream channel; and channel deposits form in the stream channel itself. Bars, which are **elongated mounds** of sediment, are transient features that form in the stream channel and on the banks. They commonly form in one year and erode the next. Rivers used for commercial navigation must be recharged frequently because bars shift from year to year. Imagine a **winding** stream. The water on the outside of the curve moves faster than the water on the inside. The stream erodes its outside bank because the current's **inertia** drives it into the outside bank. At the same time, the slower water on the inside point of the bend deposits sediment, forming a point bar. A mid-channel bar is a sandy and gravelly deposit that forms in the middle of a stream channel.

Most streams flow in a single channel. In contrast, a **braided** stream flows in many shallow, interconnecting channels. A braided stream forms where more sediment is supplied to a stream than it can carry. The stream **dumps** the excess sediment, forming mid-channel bars. The bars gradually fill a channel, forcing the stream to overflow its banks and erode new channels. As a result, a braided stream flows simultaneously in several channels and shifts back and forth across its floodplain. Braided streams are common in both deserts and glacial environments because both produce abundant sediment. A desert yields large amounts of sediment because it has little or no vegetation to prevent erosion. Glaciers grind bedrock into fine sediment, which is carried by streams flowing from the melting ice. If a **steep** mountain stream flows onto a flat plain, its gradient and velocity decrease sharply. As a result, it deposits most of its sediment in a fan-shaped mound called an alluvial fan. Alluvial fans are common in many arid and semiarid mountainous regions.

A stream also slows abruptly where it enters the still water of a lake or ocean. The sediment settles out to form a nearly flat landform called a delta. Part of the delta lies above water level, and the remainder lies slightly below water level. Deltas are commonly fan-shaped, resembling the Greek letter "delta" (∆). Both deltas and alluvial fans change rapidly. Sediment fills channels (waterways), which are then abandoned while new channels develop as in a braided stream. As a result, a stream feeding a delta or fan splits into many channels called **distributaries**. A large delta may spread out in this manner until it covers thousands of square kilometers. Most fans, however, are much smaller, covering a **fraction** of a square kilometer to a few square kilometers. The Mississippi River has flowed through seven different delta channels during the past 5,000 to 6,000 years. But in recent years, engineers have built great systems of levees (retaining walls) in attempts to stabilize the channels.

<summary>TPO52 Natufian Culture</summary>

In the archaeological record of the Natufian period, from about 12,500 to 10,200 years ago, in the part of the Middle East known as the Levant - roughly east of the Mediterranean and north of the Arabian Peninsula - we see clear evidence of agricultural origins. The stone tools of the Natufians included many **sickle-shaped cutting blades** that show a pattern of wear characteristic of cereal harvesting. Also, **querns** (hand **mills**) and other stone tools used for processing grain occur in abundance at Natufian sites, and many such tools show signs of long, intensive use. Along with the sickle blades are many **grinding** stones, primarily **mortars** and **pestles** of limestone or **basalt**. There is also evidence that these heavy **grinding** stones were transported over long distances, more than 30 kilometers in some cases, and this is not something known to have been done by people of preceding periods. Fishhooks and weights for sinking fishing nets **attest to** the growing importance of fish in the diet in some areas. Stone vessels indicate an increased need for containers, but there is no evidence of Natufian clay working or **pottery**. Studies of the teeth of Natufians also strongly suggest that these people specialized in collecting cereals and may have been cultivating them and in the process of **domesticating** them, but they were also still **hunter-foragers** who intensively hunted **gazelle** and deer in more **lush** areas and wild goats and equids in more arid zones.

The Natufians had a different settlement pattern from that of their predecessors. Some of their base camps were far larger (over 1,000 square meters) than any of those belonging to earlier periods, and they may have lived in some of these camps for half the year or even more. In some of the camps, people made **foundations** and other architectural elements out of **limestone blocks**. Trade in **shell**, obsidian, and other commodities seems to have been on the rise, and anthropologists suspect that the exchange of **perishables** (such as skins, foodstuffs) and salt was also on the increase. With the growing importance of wild cereals in the diet, salt probably became for the first time a near necessity: people who eat a lot of meat get many essential salts from this diet, but diets based on cereals can be deficient in salts. Salt was probably also important as a food **preservative** in early villages.

As always, there is more to a major cultural change than simply a shift in economics. The Natufians made (and **presumably** wore) beads and **pendants** in many materials, including **gemstones** and marine shells that had to be imported, and it is possible that this **ornamentation** actually reflects a growing sense of ethnic identity and perhaps some differences in personal and group status. Cleverly carved **figurines** of animals, women, and other subjects occur in many sites, and Natufian period cave paintings have been found in Anatolia, Syria, and Iran. More than 400 Natufian burials have been found, most of them simple graves set in house floors. As archaeologist Belfer-Cohen notes, these burials may reflect an ancestor **cult** and a growing sense of community emotional ties and attachment to a particular place, and toward the end of the Natufian period, people in this area were making a strict separation between living quarters and burial grounds. In contrast with the **Pleistocene** cultures of the Levant, Natufian culture appears to have experienced considerable social change.

The question of why the Natufians differed from their predecessors in these and other ways and why they made these first steps toward farming as a way of life remains unclear. There were climate changes, of course, and growing aridity and rising population densities may have forced them to intensify the exploitation of cereals, which in turn might have stimulated the development of sickles and other tools and the **permanent** communities that make agriculture efficient. But precisely how these factors interacted with others at play is poorly understood.

<summary>TPO53 Evidence of the Earliest Writing</summary>

Although literacy appeared independently in several parts of the prehistoric world, the earliest evidence of writing is the **cuneiform** Sumerian **script** on the clay tablets of ancient Mesopotamia, which, archaeological **detective** work has revealed, had its origins in the accounting practices of commercial activity. Researchers demonstrated that **preliterate** people, to keep track of the goods they produced and exchanged, created a system of accounting using clay tokens as symbolic representations of their products. Over many thousands of years, the symbols evolved through several stages of abstraction until they became wedge- shaped (cuneiform) signs on clay tablets, recognizable as writing.

The original tokens (circa 8500 B.C.E.) were three-dimensional solid shapes—tiny **spheres**, **cones**, disks, and cylinders. A debt of six units of grain and eight head of **livestock**, for example might have been represented by six **conical** and eight **cylindrical** tokens. To keep batches of tokens together, an innovation was introduced (circa 3250 B. C. E.) whereby they were **sealed** inside clay envelopes that could be broken open and counted when it came time for a debt to be repaid. But because the contents of the envelopes could easily be forgotten, two-dimensional representations of the three-dimensional tokens were impressed into the surface of the envelopes before they were sealed. Eventually, having two sets of equivalent symbols—the internal tokens and external markings—came to seem **redundant**, so the tokens were **eliminated** (**circa** 3250-3100 B.C.E.), and only solid clay tablets with two-dimensional symbols were **retained**. Over time, the symbols became more numerous, varied, and abstract and came to represent more than trade commodities, evolving eventually into cuneiform writing.

The evolution of the symbolism is reflected in the archaeological record first of all by the increasing complexity of the tokens themselves. The earliest tokens, dating from about 10,000 to 6,000 years ago, were of only the simplest **geometric** shapes. But about 3500 B.C.E., more complex tokens came into common usage, including many naturalistic forms shaped like miniature tools, furniture, fruit, and humans. The earlier, plain tokens were counters for agricultural products, whereas the complex ones stood for finished products, such as bread, oil, perfume, wool, and rope, and for items produced in workshops, such as metal, **bracelets**, types of cloth, **garments**, **mats**, pieces of furniture, tools, and a variety of stone and pottery vessels. The signs marked on clay tablets likewise evolved from simple wedges, circles, **ovals**, and triangles based on the plain tokens to pictographs derived from the complex tokens.

Before this evidence came to light, the inventors of writing were assumed by researchers to have been an intellectual elite. Some, for example, hypothesized that writing emerged when members of the **priestly caste** agreed among themselves on written signs. But the association of the plain tokens with the first farmers and of the complex tokens with the first artisans—and the fact that the token-and-envelope accounting system invariably represented only small-scale transactions—testifies to the **relatively modest** social status of the creators of writing.

And not only of literacy, but **numeracy** (the representation of quantitative concepts) as well. The evidence of the tokens provides further confirmation that mathematics originated in people’s desire to keep records of **flocks** and other goods. Another immensely significant step occurred around 3100 B.C.E., when Sumerian accountants extended the token-based signs to include the first real **numerals**. Previously, units of grain had been represented by direct one-to-one correspondence―by repeating the token or symbol for a unit of grain the required number of times. The accountants, however, devised numeral signs distinct from commodity signs, so that eighteen units of grain could be indicated by preceding a single grain symbol with a symbol denoting "18." Their invention of abstract numerals and abstract counting was one of the most revolutionary advances in the history of mathematics.

What was the social status of the anonymous accountants who produced this breakthrough? The immense volume of clay tablets unearthed in the ruins of the Sumerian temples where the accounts were kept suggests a social differentiation within the **scribal** class, with a virtual army of lower-ranking **tabulators** performing the monotonous job of **tallying** commodities. We can only speculate as to how high or low the inventors of true numerals were in the scribal **hierarchy**, but it stands to reason that this **laborsaving** innovation would have been the **brainchild** of the lower-ranking types whose **drudgery** it eased.

<summary>TPO53 Rain Forest Soils</summary>

On viewing the lush plant growth of a tropical rain forest, most people would conclude that the soil beneath it is rich in nutrients. However, although rain forest soils are highly variable, they have in common the fact that abundant rainfall washes mineral nutrients out of them and into streams. This process is known as **leaching**. Because of rain leaching, most tropical rain forest soils have low to very low mineral nutrient content, in dramatic contrast to mineral-rich grassland soils. Tropical forest soils also often contain particular types of clays that, unlike the mineral-binding clays of **temperate** forest soils, do not bind mineral ions well. Aluminum is the dominant **cation** (positively charged **ion**) present in tropical soils; but plants do not require this element, and it is moderately toxic to a wide range of plants. Aluminum also reduces the availability of **phosphorus**, an element in high demand by plants.

High moisture and temperatures speed the growth of soil microbes that **decompose** organic compounds, so tropical soils typically contain far lower amounts of organic materials (**humus**) than do other forest or grassland soils. Because organic compounds help loosen compact clay soils, hold water, and bind mineral nutrients, the relative lack of organic materials in tropical soils is **deleterious** to plants. Plant roots cannot **penetrate** far into hard clay soils, and during dry periods, the soil cannot hold enough water to supply plant needs. Because the concentration of dark-colored organic materials is low in tropical soils, they are often colored red or yellow by the presence of iron, aluminum: and manganese oxides; when dry, these soils become rock hard. The famous Cambodian temples of Angkor Wat, which have survived for many centuries, were constructed from blocks of such hard rain forest soils.

Given such poor soils, how can lush tropical forests exist? The answer is that the forest's minerals are held in its living biomass—the trees and other plants and the animals. In contrast to grasslands, where a large proportion of plant biomass is produced underground, that of tropical forests is nearly all aboveground. Dead leaves, branches, and other plant parts, as well as the **wastes** and bodies of rain forest animals, barely reach the forest floor before they are rapidly **decayed** by abundant decomposers—bacterial and **fungal**. Minerals released by decay are quickly absorbed by **multitudinous** shallow, fine tree feeder roots and stored in plant tissues. Many tropical rain forest plants (like those in other forests) have **mycorrhizal** (**fungus**-root) partners whose delicate **hyphae** spread through great volumes of soil, from which they release and absorb minerals and ferry them back to the host plant in exchange for needed organic compounds. The fungal hyphae are able to absorb phosphorus that plant roots could not themselves obtain from the very dilute soil solutions, and fungal hyphae can transfer mineral nutrients from one forest plant to another. Consequently, tropical rain forests typically have what are known as closed nutrient systems, in which minerals are handed off from one organism to another with little leaking through to the soil. When mineral nutrients do not spend much time in the soil, they cannot be leached into streams. Closed nutrient systems have evolved in response to the leaching effects of heavy tropical rainfall. Evidence for this conclusion is that nutrient systems are more open in the richest tropical soils and tightest in the poorest soils.

The growth of organisms is dependent on the availability of nutrients, none of which is more important than nitrogen. Although there is an abundant supply of nitrogen in Earth’s atmosphere, it cannot be absorbed by plants unless it is "fixed," or combined chemically with other elements to form nitrogen compounds. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria help tropical rain forest plants cope with the poor soils there by supplying them with needed nitrogen. Many species of tropical rain forest trees belong to the **legume** family, which is known for associations of nitrogen-fixing bacteria within root nodules. Also, **cycads** (a type of tropical plant that resembles a **palm** tree) produce special aboveground roots that harbor nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. By growing above the ground, the roots are exposed to sunlight, which the cyanobacteria require for growth. Nitrogen fixation by free-living bacteria in tropical soils is also beneficial.

<summary>TPO54 The Commercialization of Lumber</summary>

In nineteenth-century America, practically everything that was built involved wood. Pine was especially attractive for building purposes.It is durable and strong, yet soft enough to be easily worked with even the simplest of hand tools.It also floats nicely on water, which allowed it to be transported to distant markets across the nation.The central and northern reaches of the Great Lakes states—Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota—all contained extensive pine forests as well as many large rivers for floating logs into the Great Lakes, from where they were transported nationwide.

By 1860, the settlement of the American West along with **timber** shortages in the East converged with ever-widening impact on the pine forests of the Great Lakes states. Over the next 30 years, **lumbering** became a **full-fledged** enterprise in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Newly formed lumbering corporations bought up huge tracts of pineland and set about systematically cutting the trees. Both the colonists and the later industrialists saw timber as a commodity, but the latter group adopted a far more thorough and calculating approach to removing trees. In this sense, what happened between 1860 and 1890 represented a significant break with the past. No longer were farmers in search of extra income the main source for **shingles**, firewood, and other wood products. By the 1870s, farmers and city dwellers alike purchased forest products from large manufacturing companies located in the Great Lakes states rather than chopping wood themselves or buying it locally.

The commercialization of lumbering was in part the product of technological change. The early, thick saw blades tended to waste a large quantity of wood, with perhaps as much as a third of the log left behind on the floor as **sawdust** or **scrap**. In the 1870s, however, the British-invented band saw, with its thinner blade, became standard issue in the Great Lakes states' lumber factories.Meanwhile, the rise of steam-powered mills streamlined production by allowing for the more efficient, centralized, and continuous cutting of lumber. Steam helped to automate a variety of tasks, from cutting to the carrying away of waste. Mills also employed steam to heat log ponds, preventing them from freezing and making possible year-round lumber production.

For industrial lumbering to succeed, a way had to be found to **neutralize** the effects of the seasons on production. Traditionally, cutting took place in the winter, when snow and ice made it easier to drag logs on **sleds** or **sleighs** to the banks of streams. Once the streams and lakes **thawed**, workers rafted the logs to mills, where they were cut into lumber in the summer. If nature did not cooperate—if the winter proved dry and warm, if the spring thaw was delayed—production would suffer. To counter the effects of climate on lumber production, loggers **experimented** with a variety of techniques for transporting trees out of the woods. In the 1870s, loggers in the Great Lakes states began **sprinkling** water on sleigh roads, giving them an artificial ice **coating** to facilitate travel. The ice reduced the friction and allowed workers to move larger and heavier loads.

But all the sprinkling in the world would not save a logger from the threat of a warm winter. Without snow the sleigh roads turned to mud. In the 1870s, a set of snowless winters left lumber companies to **ponder** ways of liberating themselves from the seasons. Railroads were one possibility.At first, the remoteness of the pine forests discouraged common carriers from laying track.But increasing lumber prices in the late 1870s combined with periodic warm, dry winters compelled loggers to turn to iron rails. By 1887, 89 logging railroads crisscrossed Michigan, transforming logging from a winter activity into a year-round one.

Once the logs arrived at a river, the trip downstream to a mill could be a long and **tortuous** one.**Logjams** (buildups of logs that prevent logs from moving downstream) were common—at times **stretching** for 10 miles—and became even more frequent as pressure on the northern Midwest pinelands increased in the 1860s. To help keep the logs moving efficiently, barriers called booms (essentially a chain of floating logs) were constructed to control the direction of the timber. By the 1870s, lumber companies existed in all the major logging areas of the northern Midwest.

<summary>TPO54 Overkill of the North American Megafauna</summary>

Thousands of years ago, in North America's past, all of its **megafauna**—large mammals such as **mammoths** and giant bears—disappeared. One proposed explanation for this event is that when the first Americans migrated over from Asia, they hunted the megafauna to extinction.These people, known as the Clovis society after a site where their distinctive spear points were first found, would have been able to use this food source to expand their population and fill the continent rapidly.Yet many scientists argue against this "**Pleistocene** overkill" hypothesis. Modern humans have certainly been capable of such **drastic** effects on animals, but could ancient people with little more than stone spears similarly have caused the extinction of numerous species of animals?Thirty-five **genera** or groups of species (and many individual species) suffered extinction in North America around 11,000 B.C., soon after the appearance and expansion of **Paleo**-lndians throughout the Americas (27 genera disappeared completely, and another 8 became locally extinct, surviving only outside North America).

Although the climate changed at the end of the Pleistocene, warming trends had happened before. A period of massive extinction of large mammals like that seen about 11,000 years ago had not occurred during the previous 400,000 years, despite these changes. The only apparently significant difference in the Americas 11,000 years ago was the presence of human hunters of these large mammals. Was this coincidence or cause-and-effect?

We do not know.Ecologist Paul S. Martin has **championed** the model that associates the extinction of large mammals at the end of the Pleistocene with human predation.With researcher J. E. Mosimann, he has co-authored a work in which a computer model showed that in around 300 years, given the right conditions, a small **influx** of hunters into eastern Beringia 12,000 years ago could have spread across North America in a wave and wiped out game animals to feed their **burgeoning** population.

The researchers ran the model several ways, always beginning with a population of 100 humans in Edmonton, in Alberta, Canada, at 11,500 years ago.Assuming different initial North American big-game-animal populations (75-150 million animals) and different population growth rates for the human settlers (0.65%-3.5%), and varying kill rates, Mosimann and Martin **derived** figures of between 279 and 1,157 years from initial contact to big-game extinction.

Many scholars continue to support this scenario.For example, geologist Larry Agenbroad has mapped the locations of dated Clovis sites alongside the distribution of dated sites where the remains of wooly mammoths have been found in both archaeological and purely paleontological contexts.These distributions show remarkable **synchronicity** (occurrence at the same time).

There are, however, many problems with this model.Significantly, though a few sites are quite impressive, there really is very little archaeological evidence to support it.Writing in 1982, Martin himself admitted the **paucity** of evidence;for example, at that point, the remains of only 38 individual mammoths had been found at Clovis sites. In the years since, few additional mammoths have been added to the list;there are still fewer than 20 Clovis sites where the remains of one or more mammoths have been recovered, a **minuscule** proportion of the millions that necessarily would have had to have been slaughtered within the overkill scenario.

Though Martin claims the lack of evidence actually supports his model—the evidence is **sparse** because the spread of humans and the extinction of animals occurred so quickly—this argument seems weak. And how could we ever disprove it?As archaeologist Donald Grayson points out, in other cases where extinction resulted from the quick spread of human hunters—for example, the extinction of the **moa**, the large **flightless** bird of New Zealand—archaeological evidence in the form of remains is abundant. Grayson has also shown that the evidence is not so clear that all or even most of the large **herbivores** in late Pleistocene America became extinct after the appearance of Clovis. Of the 35 extinct genera, only 8 can be confidently assigned an extinction date of between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago.Many of the older genera, Grayson argues, may have **succumbed** before 12,000 B.C., at least half a century before the Clovis showed up in the American West.

<summary>TPO55 Mesolithic Complexity in Scandinavia </summary>

The European Mesolithic (roughly the period from 8000 B.C. to 2700 B.C.) testifies to a continuity in human culture from the times of the Ice Age. This continuity, however was based on continuous adjustment to environmental changes following the end of the last glacial period (about 12,500 years ago). Three broad **subdivisions** within the northern Mesolithic are known in Scandinavia. The Maglemose Period (7500 -5700 B.C) was a time of seasonal exploitation of rivers and lakes, combined with terrestrial hunting and **foraging**. The sites from the Kongemose Period (5700-4600 B.C.) are mainly on the Baltic Sea coasts, along bays and near **lagoons**, where the people exploited both marine and terrestrial resources. Many Kongemose sites are somewhat larger than Maglemose ones. The Ertebolle Period (4600-3200 B.C.) was the **culmination** of Mesolithic culture in southern Scandinavia.

By the Ertebolle Period, the Scandinavians were occupying coastal settlements year-round and subsisting off a very wide range of food sources. These included forest game and waterfowl, shellfish, sea mammals, and both shallow-water and deepwater fish. There were smaller seasonal coastal sites, too: for specific activities such as deepwater fishing, **sealing**, or hunting of migratory birds. One such site, the Aggersund site in Denmark, was occupied for short periods of time in the autumn, when the **inhabitants** collected oysters and hunted some game, especially migratory swans. Ertebolle technology was far more elaborate than that of its Mesolithic predecessors; a wide variety of **antler**, bone: and wood tools for specialized purposes such as fowling and sea-mammal hunting were developed, including **dugout canoes** up to ten meters long.

With **sedentary** settlement comes evidence of greater social complexity in the use of **cemeteries** for burials and changes in burial practices. The trend toward more sedentary settlement the cemeteries, and the **occasional** social differentiation revealed by elaborate burials are all reflections of an intensified use of resources among these relatively affluent hunter-gatherers of 3000 B.C. Mesolithic societies intensified the food quest by exploiting many more marine species, making productive use of migratory waterfowl and their breeding grounds, and collecting shellfish in enormous numbers. This intensification is also reflected in a much more elaborate and diverse technology, more exchange of goods and materials between neighbors, greater variety in settlement types, and a slowly rising population throughout southern Scandinavia. These phenomena may, in part; be a reflection of rising sea levels throughout the Mesolithic that flooded many cherished territories. There are signs, too, of regional variations in artifact forms and styles, indicative of cultural differences between people living in **well-delineated** **territories** and competing for resources.

Mesolithic cultures are much less well-defined elsewhere in Europe, partly because the climatic changes were less extreme than in southern Scandinavia and because there were fewer opportunities for coastal adaptation. In much of central Europe, settlement was confined to lakeside and riverside locations, widely separated from one another by dense forests. Many Mesolithic lakeside sites were located in **transitional** zones between different environments so that the inhabitants could return to a central base location, where for much of the year they lived close to predictable resources such as lake fish. However, they would exploit both forest **game** and other seasonal resources from **satellite** camps. For example, the archaeologist Michael Jochim believes that some groups lived during most of the year in camps along the Danube River in central Europe, moving to summer **encampments** on the shores of neighboring lakes. In areas like Spain, there appears to have been intensified exploitation of marine and forest resources. There was a trend nearly everywhere toward greater variety in the diet, with more attention being paid to less obvious foods and to those that require more complex processing methods than do game and other such resources.

Thus, in parts of Europe, there was a long-term trend among hunter-gatherer societies toward a more extensive exploitation of food resources, often within the context of a strategy that **sought** ways to minimize the impact of environmental uncertainty. In more favored southern Scandinavia, such societies achieved a new level of social complexity that was to become commonplace among later farming peoples, and this preadaptation proved an important catalyst for rapid economic and social change when farming did come to Europe.

<summary>TPO55 Evolution of the Flowering Plants </summary>

Many aspects of the history of flowering plants (**angiosperms**) remain mysterious. Evidence of the earliest angiosperms comes from fossilized leaves, stems, fruits, pollen, and, very rarely, flowers. In addition, there has been much study of modern plant **morphology** (structure) and genetics in order to determine which living species might be most closely related to the ancient ancestors of angiosperms. Despite intensive efforts for over 200 years, scientists have still not reached consensus on which type of plant was the ancestor to the angiosperms, and when and where the angiosperms first evolved. Indeed, Charles Darwin himself called the origin of the flowering plants an "**abominable** mystery."

What type of plant was the ancestor to the angiosperms? Most botanists now agree that the flowering plants are **monophyletic** in origin, meaning that they evolved from a common ancestor. Some **paleontologists** have suggested that the common ancestor may have been a type of **cycad** (**palmlike** tropical plants). Other paleontologists maintain that the angiosperms may have evolved from seed-bearing **ferns**. Finally, analysis of the morphological traits of some primitive living plants suggests that the ancestor may have been related to the modern pines. The question of angiosperm ancestry remains unresolved.

The time and place of the first appearance of flowering plants have long been a topic of great interest. There is good fossil evidence that early angiosperms, including a number **resembling** modern **magnolias**, were present in the Early Cretaceous geologic period (more than 100 million years ago). Angiosperms became increasingly abundant during this period. Between 100 million and 65 million years ago, a period known as the Late **Cretaceous**, angiosperms increased from less than 1 percent of flora (plant life) to well over 50 percent. Many of the modern plant families appeared during this time period. In the Early **Tertiary** period which followed: angiosperms increased to comprise 90 percent or more of Earth's total flora. Where did these successful plants first originate and spread from?

Analysis of the fossil leaf structure and geographic distribution of the earliest Cretaceous angiosperms has led many biogeographers to conclude that they evolved in the tropics and then migrated poleward. It is known that angiosperms did not become dominant in the high latitudes until the Late Cretaceous. Paleontologists have recovered fossil angiosperm leaves, stems, and pollen from Early Cretaceous deposits in eastern South America and western Africa. These two continents were joined together as part of Gondwanaland, one of two supercontinents that existed at that time. The locations of these early angiosperm finds would have been close to the equator during the Early Cretaceous and are conformable with a model by which angiosperms spread from the tropics poleward.

Not all botanists agree with an African-South American center for the evolution and dispersal of the angiosperms, pointing out that many of the most primitive forms of flowering plants are found in the South Pacific, including portions of Fiji, New Caledonia, New Guinea, eastern Australia, and the Malay Archipelago. Recent genetic research has identified the rare tropical shrub Amborella as being the living plant most closely related to the ancient ancestor of all the angiosperms. This small shrub, which has tiny yellow-white flowers and red fruit; is found only on New Caledonia, a group of islands in the South Pacific. Many botanists conclude that the best explanation for the large numbers of primitive living angiosperms in the South Pacific region is that this is where the flowering plants first evolved and these modern species are relics of this early evolution. Comparisons of the DNA of **Amborella** and many hundreds of species of flowering plants suggest that the first angiosperm arose and the development of separate species occurred about 135 million years ago.

Recently discovered fossils complicate our understanding of the origin of the angiosperms even further. Paleontologists from China have found beautifully preserved fossils of an angiosperm plant, including flowers and seeds, in **Jurassic** period deposits from China. The site, which is about 130 million years old, is near modern Beijing. The new fossil plant found at the site is now the oldest known angiosperm. The age of the fossils and the very primitive features of the flowers have led the discoverers to suggest that the earliest flowering plants may have evolved in northern Asia.

<summary>Official1 Aquatic Desert Animals </summary>

It may seem surprising, but desert animals have made few specific bodily adaptations to the desert environment. Rather, they manage to survive through proper timing of their biological activities, and this is best illustrated by semiaquatic and aquatic desert animals.

The aquatic nature of amphibians makes them seem unlikely desert residents. Reproduction requires open water, where the female and male deposit the eggs and **sperm**, respectively, and **fertilization** occurs. Development of the fertilized eggs occurs in water, and the **gilled** and legless juveniles must swim and feed in water. It is only the adult that can survive on land, but the poorly developed lungs and water-permeable skin restrict them to moister habitats. Amphibians beat the **odds**, not with extremely adaptive structures or organic processes but with a life history in which their activity and reproduction occur during brief periods of favorable conditions. And no amphibian better illustrates this ability than the **spadefoot toad** of the southern United States deserts.

During the drier winter season the adult spade foot remains dormant underground, sometimes nearly a meter deep. Nested below the surface, where the toad is protected from **desiccating** air and temperature extremes, the spadefoot is enveloped by **un-shed** skin that forms a **cocoon** **of sorts**. Water stored in tissue and in the **bladder** is slowly lost, but the spadefoot is able to lose some 50 percent of its water and survive. And so the toad waits, sometimes for more than two years, until heavy rains come with enough moisture to create temporary pools in which it can reproduce.

Water will awaken spadefoot toads, but in some cases simply the **thumping** of raindrops on the surface is enough to arouse them from their **torpor**. Hastening to shallow, temporary pools, the spadefoots mate. The females lay several thousand eggs that are less than 2 millimeters in diameter. The fertilized eggs develop quickly, and in warm water the **tadpoles** can emerge from their eggs shells in less than two days. Tadpole development requires just one to three weeks, and if pool evaporation is outpacing development, **metamorphosis** (the series of physical changes occurring after hatching or birth) is accelerated, resulting in smaller spadefoots. The omnivorous tadpoles can resort to **cannibalism**, the larger eating the smaller, and predation by other species is also common. **Mortality** is high, and not infrequently the pool dries before even the largest tadpoles have fully metamorphosed into adults. Spadefoot tadpole can help prolong the life of their aquatic habitat, however. Before full metamorphosis they collect into **squirming** **swarms** that agitate the water and stir the mud, thereby creating a deeper depression that retains the water. After they are fully metamorphosed and leave their aquatic nursery, adult spadefoot toads feed on the insects flourishing in the moist post-rain environment before returning underground to wait out the next drought.

Even more surprising are the aquatic animals that find a way to survive in the desert. Temporary bodies of water, including flat-bottomed basins known as playas, can host strictly aquatic species, the most prominent of which are crustaceans such as fairy shrimp.

The fairy shrimp survive as **cysts**, actually shelled embryos, in the dry playas of the Mojave Desert. Here they may reside for years, possibly even several decades, dehydrated, inactive, and **inconspicuous**. Under the right conditions, rain will bring the fairy shrimp out of dormancy. Cooler, near-freezing temperatures promote hatching, for in the Mojave Desert heavy rains and more reliable playa flooding occur in winter. Timely hatching is also promoted by dilute, non-saline water that comes with initial playa flooding. With time the playa’s salts permeate the water, and further cyst hatching is inhibited as the lake dries. However, additional rains may dilute the salts, and hatching is renewed with the promise that the lake's life will be prolonged.

The cysts hatch promptly but often face a less-than-ideal environment. Nevertheless, complete development may take as little as ten days. With time, more and more predators arrive, including winged insects that arrive from afar. The fairy shrimps that survive **readily** reproduce, and the resulting cysts settle to the bottom and are left to survive the next drought. Thus, as long as water persists three weeks or so, the fairy shrimp has time to complete its life cycle.

<summary>Official2 Can lo and Europa Support Life?</summary>

Some scientists think that two of Jupiter's four large ("**Galilean**") moons, lo and Europa, may be candidates for hosting life-in part because both of them have two important preconditions, water and an energy source. lo is similar to the rocky inner planets (such as Earth and Mars) in its composition, having an iron core and large amounts of silicon. Proximity to Jupiter makes it far more geologically dynamic than any other planet or moon. **Tidal forces**- caused by the gravitational effects of Jupiter and other moons-**deform** lo as it passes through its orbit. The process heats the moon, and constant volcanism results as the surface crust fails to keep in the **sloshing** magma (**liquefied** rock) underneath. The surface can change up to a hundred meters between high and low tide in some places. Other than Earth, lo is the only object in the solar system known to have currently active volcanoes. Eruptions wipe out all evidence of meteoric impacts; no craters can be seen on the surface.

lo seems, however, to have too much energy to make a good habitat for life. In addition to volcanism, the moon gets energy from the intense magnetic field of Jupiter. As the moon passes through this field, tremendous amounts of energy are generated. The forces **strip** nearly a ton of mass from the surface every second, creating a cloud of charged ions around the moon. Life as we know it would quickly dissolve on the surface of lo.  

The second nearest of the Galilean satellites is Europa. In many respects it ***resembles*** lo, <u>but its composition is radically different. </u>Europa possesses large quantities of water, either as ice or as a liquid. ***Massive*** tides warm Europa, though they are only about **one-tenth** as strong as the ones affecting lo. On this moon, the tides probably maintain an ***extensive*** ocean under the sea ice. Several lines of evidence point to liquid water. Planetary scientists were surprised to discover that very few large craters exist on the surface. Some process must be ***resurfacing*** the planet on a regular basis, leading many to believe that liquid water **spills out**. Second, the Galileo spacecraft detected a magnetic field ***induced*** by Jupiter. Some conducting material must be present around the inside of the planet. Liquid water with salts seems the most likely solution. Finally, the mass and size of Europa are consistent with an ice-and-water mixture.

Unfortunately, Europa exploration will prove difficult. Engineers are working on plans to reach the subsurface ocean, but currently there are no workable plans to place a drill on the surface that could tunnel through many kilometers of ice. Looking at all the evidence, planetary scientists believe that Europa consists of a rocky core accounting for less than one-half its depth. Over this core rest many kilometers of liquid water and ice. Different models give different depths of surface ice over the ocean, and further studies of composition, salinity, and surface features will certainly lead to a better understanding, but a large saltwater ocean seems probable. Tidal forces from interactions with Jupiter and other moons would keep the water liquid despite the **subfreezing** exterior temperature of -170° **Celsius**. Craters would be ***eliminated*** whenever meteors pierced the surface ice or tidal forces formed giant ***cracks***. Saltwater from underneath would spread out and freeze, making a new top layer in the area around the event.

The importance of liquid water to life causes astrobiologists to be very excited about Europa. Liquid water appears to be rare other than on Earth, but here we have an ocean of it. Nonetheless, a number of other ***considerations*** are important. Carbon might not be difficult to find, as long as some form of internal circulation rotates heavier metals from the rocky core out into the water. <u>Energy might be more difficult, though. </u>**Solar** radiation hits the icy surface where life is unlikely to survive. Energy would have to be generated from some other source under the ice, possibly volcanic or magnetic processes. Some **astrobiologists** believe that Europa could have magma **vents** (surface openings through which materials escape) like the deep-sea vents at the **midoceanic** ridges on Earth. Such vents could provide both carbon and energy for an ecosystem.

Companies make packaged food without synthetic dyes in other countries. But despite pressure from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the change isn’t likely to happen quickly in the United States.

Same cereal. Same sugary taste. Different hues.

A box of Froot Loops sold in the United States contains vivid rings of red, orange, green, purple, yellow and blue — neon colors derived from synthetic dyes, like Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Blue No. 1 and Yellow No. 6. In a box sold in Canada, the colored rings obtain **paler** shades from the juices of blueberries, watermelon and **huito**, an Amazonian fruit. And not a single one is blue.

The manufacturer in both countries, WK Kellogg, formerly known as the Kellogg Company, can clearly make Froot Loops without synthetic dyes. The question is: Will it and other big food companies adopt the approach in United States? And will consumers, raised on color-popping cereals, flame-colored nacho chips and neon blue sports drinks consume those foods if they are a bit more … **beige**?

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, wants them to. On Tuesday, Mr. Kennedy, who has long criticized artificial dyes used in Froot Loops and other processed foods as part of a larger food system that he says contributes to chronic disease and poor health, announced that he had [reached “an understanding”](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/rfk-jr-food-dye-ban-sugar.html) with major food manufacturers to remove commonly used petroleum-based food colorings from their products by 2026.

The meaning of “an understanding” remains unclear. No food companies attended the press conference, and few have said they will remove synthetic colors, which the Food and Drug Administration currently allows. But a shift may be coming. This week, citing expected demand from consumers, the beverage giant PepsiCo, which also makes Doritos and Lay’s potato chips, said it would either phase out synthetic colors or offer consumers natural color options in the next couple of years.


其他国家的公司生产不含合成染料的包装食品，这种变化在美国不太可能很快发生。

在美国出售的一盒Froot Loops包含来自合成染料的鲜艳的霓虹色，在加拿大出售的盒子里，这些从蓝莓、西瓜和亚马逊水果“huito”的汁液中获得了更淡的色调。

这两个国家的制造商WK Kellogg，显然可以在不使用合成染料的情况下制造Froot Loops。但如果消费者吃的是更鲜艳颜色的食物，他们可能不会吃颜色寡淡的食物。

小罗伯特·F·肯尼迪希望他们这样做，他宣布已经达成了“理解”，到2026年，主要食品制造商将从其产品中去除常用的石油基食品色素。

尽管其他公司会不会采取措施是不确定的，但转变可能即将到来。饮料巨头百事公司表示将在未来几年内逐步淘汰合成色素或为消费者提供天然色素选择。

<summary>Official3 Agriculture in Classical China</summary>

In classical China (1000 B.C.E.-500 c.E.), farmers and farming enjoyed greater standing than in most other civilizations. In the official Chinese social hierarchy, farmers came after the scholar-**bureaucrats** in prestige. Such was the prestige of farming in classical China that even scholars tried to keep their hand in agriculture, engaging when they could in plowing or other agrarian activities. After the farmers came artisans and, lastly, merchants, actors, and other groups presumed to be disreputable. In theory, **peasants** could become government officials; during the Han dynasty (202 B.C.E.-220 C.E.), discrimination against traders increased, even leading to a prohibition against merchants becoming state officials. Traders were, however, typically much wealthier than the vast majority of the peasants, bringing about contradictions between wealth and social prestige. The lack of prestige in commerce did make the wealthy prefer to invest in land rather than in trading ventures, leading to increased landlordism.

The majority of the population were either peasants who owned their own land or permanent workers who cultivated plots that they did not own but that remained in the same family for many generations. This pattern had emerged in the preclassical period under the Zhou dynasty (1046-256 B.C.E.). The Zhou formed China's feudal period, in which political unity was an ideal rarely, if ever, achieved. Instead, the relatively weak central government and the rival kingdoms gave away land to aristocrats in exchange for armaments, horses, and other military needs. These aristocrats had to supply loyalty and military services to their benefactors. In return for military protection, peasants paid a certain percentage of their crops to the aristocrats, in what is called a manorial system. The landlords restricted the movement of the rural workers; after all, it was the peasants' work that made the land produce, and peasants' movement elsewhere meant the land, less productive, could yield less to the aristocracy.

The classical period in China was punctuated by a social revolution. In the Qin dynasty (221-202 B.c.E.), the emperor decreed the liberty of all manorial peasants, giving them the land they had worked for generations. During the Qin period, this decree probably did not mean much less actual work, for it was during this dynasty that the emperor bilt much of what we know of as the Great Wall. The authoritarian methods to recruit workers brought about widespread discontent and, ironically, led to the Qin emperor's overthrow. The abolition of the manorial system was permanent, however, and led to higher population growth, as well as spontaneous migration to the fertile and less densely populated lands in southern China. The consequences of these actions had lasting importance for rural labor patterns. In the first place, instead of millet and wheat, peasants increasingly began to cultivate rice, which grew well in the hot southern climate. In addition, population growth diminished the size of the plots of households, especially in the densely settled eastern portion of the empire. By the time of the Han dynasty, the standard landholding of one farming family with seven members was slightly less than 5 acres. The small plot size meant that Chinese peasants had to engage in intensive farming. They had to use deep tilling (digging soil to prepare for planting) techniques and irrigation and to invest a much greater amount of labor into their plots, with frequent weeding, fertilizing, careful thinning, and the like. In the south, where winters came late or were mild, cultivators frequently tried to plant and harvest more than one crop annually or to plant a staple crop such as millet in between mulberry trees.

This intense activity was not enough in years of droughts, overabundant rainfall, or other natural disasters. Peasants needed to generate other income to cover their taxes and pay for other goods that they might want to acquire. The most important subsidiary activity was weaving, done mainly by women, as the ancient Chinese refrain "man as tiller, woman as weaver" suggests. Indeed, the Han considered agriculture and weaving to be complementary, a distinctive trait of Chinese rural life. Even when they were sitting at their doorsteps conversing with their neighbors, women spun fibers or kept busy in other ways. It is possible that weaving brought in almost as much income as farming.

<summary>Official4 Evidence for Continental Drift</summary>

Continental drift refers to the idea that the present continents once formed a single. giant continent called Pangaea, and since that time have been slowly drifting apart. In 1915 the originator of this idea, the German meteorologist Alfred Wegener, was impressed by the close resemblance of coastlines of continents on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, particularly South America and Africa. However,the configuration of the coastlines results from erosional and depositional processes and therefore is constantly being modified, so even if Wegener was right and the continents had separated in the distant past, it is not likely that the coastlines would fit exactly. But decades later it was shown that the continents fit together well along the continental slope (the broad underwater shelf on the edges of continents), where crosion is minimal, and recent studies have confirmed the close fit between continents when they are reassembled to form Pangaea.

If the continents were at one time joined, then the rocks and mountain ranges of the same age in adjoining locations on the opposite continents should closely match. Such is the case for the continents thought to have together formed the southern supercontinent Gondwana when Pangaca broke up into a northern and a southern supercontinent, mostly during the Jurassic period (200-146 million years ago) Antarctica, South America, Africa,Australia-New Guinea, and India comprised Gondwana. Marine, nonmarine, and glacial rock sequences of the Pennsylvanian epoch(325-299 million years ago)to the Jurassic period are almost identical for all five Gondwana continents, strongly indicating that they were joined at one time. The trends of several major mountain ranges also support the hypothesis of continental drift. The folded Appalachian Mountains of North America, for example, trend northeastward through the eastern United States and Canada and terminate abruptly at the Newfoundland coastline. Mountain ranges of the same age and deformational style occur in eastern Greenland, Ireland Great Britain, and Norway. Even though these mountain ranges are currently separated by the Atlantic Ocean, they form an essentially continuous mountain range when the continents are positioned next to each other.

During the later part of the Paleozoic era(544-255) million years ago massive glaciers covered large continental areas of the Southern Hemisphere, leaving behind layers of till(sediment deposited by glaciers) and striations (scratch marks) in the bedrock beneath the till. Fossils and sedimentary rocks of the same age from the Northern Hemisphere, however, give no indication of glaciation.Fossil plants found in coals indicate that the Northern Hemisphere had a tropical climate during the time that the Southern Hemisphere was glaciated.

All the Gondwana continents except Antarctica are currently located near the equator in subtropical to tropical climates. Mapping of glacial striations in bedrock in Australia India, and South America indicates that the glaciers moved from the areas of present-day oceans onto land. This would be highly unlikely because large continental glaciers (such as occurred on the Gondwana continents during the late Paleozoic era) flow outward from their central area of accumulation toward the sea. If the continents had not moved in the past, one would have to explain how glaciers moved from the oceans onto land and how large-scale continental glaciers formed near the equator. But if the continents are reassemble as a single landmass with South Africa located at the South Polc. the direction of movement of late Paleozoic continental glaciers makes sense. Furthermore, this geographic arrangement places the northern continents nearer the tropics, which is consistent with the fossil and climatologic evidence.

Finally, some of the most compelling evidence for continental drift comes from the fossil record. For example, fossils of Glossopteris, a group of woody shrubs, are found in equivalent Pennsylvanian and Permian coal deposits (299-251 million years ago) on all five Gondwana continents, Glassopteris shrubs produced seeds too large to have been carried by winds, and even if the seeds had floated across the ocean, they would not have remained viable for any length of time in salt water. The present-day- climates of the southern continents range from tropical to polar and are much too diverse to support the type of plants in the Glossopteris flora. These continents must once have been joined so that these widely separated localities were all in the same latitudinal climatic belt.

Paul presents a compelling argument that providing a financial support to electric-car companies and customers. Admittedly, economic support can meet people's needs. However, considering the various benefits of expanding public transportation, I am more agree with Claire’s statement. 

In my opinion, since the air pollution dues to a large amount of carbon dioxide emissions from cars, we should cut off its origin.  A comprehensive public transportation system can benefit not only environment but also quality of life, so people will be more willing to make changes. For example, if more public transportation stations be built, aural  people can walk or ride to station instead of driving for a long time.

Therefore, I firmly believe that the proposal for expanding public transportation is reasonable and helpful.

Paul presents a compelling argument that people may not work less and have more spare time in the future. Admittedly, the working pressure is significant today. However, considering the various benefits of more leisure time, I am inclined to trust that people will have more free time in the future. 

In my view, more leisure time means more improvement in ourselves. A lot of skills that we can not learn from work can be learned during our spare time. For example, video editing skills can be mastered while making a chill vacation vlog, and it will be useful not only in hobbies but also in a career. 

Therefore, I firmly believe that having more free time is reasonable and possible in the future.

**【题目】**

**Instructions**  

Your professor is teaching a class on education. Write a post responding to the professor's question.  

**In your response, you should do the following.**  

•Express and support your opinion.  
•Make a contribution to the discussion in your own words.  
An effective response will contain at least 100 words.  

**Doctor Achebe**

Companies now make computer games designed to help very young children learn. The games are advertised for use by children aged 2 to 8 years and often involve basic math and reading skills, presented in a fun, game-like style. Some people say that this results in children spending too much time looking at computer screens. Do you think it's a good idea for very young children to play educational computer games? Why or why not?  

**Andrew**

I think it's completely inappropriate for children as young as 2 years old to play what are essentially video games. Even if the games are educational, the same skills can be taught in traditional ways- by reading books to children, for example.  
And it would be beneficial to interact with their parents in this way.  

**Kelly**

Considering how important computers are to human societies these days, I think it actually makes sense to allow very young children to explore them. And if the computer games that children play also give them early access to subject matter that will later be taught in school, all the better.

**【回答】**

**My answer is:**

Andrew's opinion is thoughtful. Many problems will be caused if children play computer games too early, even though it's educational. 

However, I more agree with Kelly. In my view, the benefits of educational computer games are more important and make sense to the growth of children. Obviously, computers are more and more useful nowadays. If children can play educational computer games, they can learn not only knowledge but also computer skills in an early time, and it's absolutely meaningful. Also, they can gain more enjoyment during this kind of learning. 

In conclusion, I think it's wonderful for very young children to play educational computer games.

##### 初稿评分
**当前得分：3/5**  
**扣分原因：**
1. **论证单薄**：缺乏具体案例支撑（需补充日常易联想的教育场景）
2. **语言重复**：过度使用"educational computer games"（出现4次）
3. **逻辑断层**：未有效衔接Andrew的观点进行反驳
4. **语法问题**：3处典型错误+2处中式表达
##### 语法修正
**原文修改（错误处加粗+修正说明）：**

Andrew's opinion is thoughtful. Many problems will be caused if children play computer games too early, **even though it's educational** (even if they're educational).  

However, I **more agree** (agree more) with Kelly. In my view, the benefits of educational computer games are **more important** (more significant) and make sense to the growth of children. Obviously, computers are **more and more useful** (increasingly essential) nowadays. If children can play educational computer games, they can learn not only knowledge but also computer skills **in an early time** (at an early age), and it's absolutely meaningful. Also, they can **gain more enjoyment** (experience engaging learning) during this kind of learning.

In conclusion, I think it's wonderful for very young children to play educational computer games.

###### **1. "even though it’s educational" → 应改为 "even if they’re educational"**
- **错误原因**：
  - **代词错误**：前文主语是复数名词 "computer games"，但使用了单数代词 "it"（正确应为 **they**）
  - **逻辑错误**：原文想表达 **"即使这些游戏是教育类的"**，属于假设语境，而 "even though" 用于 **既定事实**，"even if" 才表示 **假设条件**
- **正确用法**：  
  *Even if they’re educational*, excessive screen time may still harm children’s eyesight.  
  （即使它们是教育类游戏，过度屏幕时间仍会损害儿童视力）
###### **2. "more agree" → 应改为 "agree more"**
- **错误原因**：
  - **副词位置错误**：英语中程度副词修饰动词时通常后置（agree strongly/partially more 是错误结构）
  - **语义混淆**：原句想表达「更倾向于同意」，正确语序应为 "agree more with..."  
- **正确用法**：  
  *I agree more* with Kelly because her argument aligns with modern educational trends.  
  （我更加认同凯莉，因为她的观点符合现代教育趋势）
###### **3. "more and more useful" → 应改为 "increasingly essential"**
- **错误原因**：
  - **重复冗余**："more and more" 在学术写作中属于冗余表达（可用 increasingly/gradually 替代）
  - **用词不当**："useful" 未能准确传达计算机在当代社会的必要性  
- **正确用法**：  
  Digital literacy has become *increasingly essential* in today’s technology-driven world.  
  （在当今技术驱动的世界中，数字素养变得越来越重要）
###### **4. "in an early time" → 应改为 "at an early age"**
- **错误原因**：
  - **介词错误**：年龄阶段固定搭配为 "at...age"（如 at the age of 5）
  - **语义模糊**："time" 无法准确表达「幼年阶段」的概念  
- **正确用法**：  
  Early exposure to logical thinking *at an early age* enhances cognitive development.  
  （幼年时期早期接触逻辑思维能促进认知发展）
###### **5. "gain more enjoyment" → 应改为 "experience engaging learning"**
- **错误原因**：
  - **搭配不当**："gain enjoyment" 多用于休闲活动（如 gain enjoyment from music）
  - **学术性不足**：未能体现教育场景中的主动参与过程  
- **正确用法**：  
  Well-designed games allow children to *experience engaging learning* through interactive challenges.  
  （精心设计的游戏通过互动挑战让孩子体验参与式学习）
###### 总结：避免此类错误的技巧
1. **主谓一致**：复数主语（games/they）→ 复数代词（they/their）  
2. **假设语境**：用 "even if" 替代 "even though"  
3. **固定搭配**：记忆高频短语（at an early age / benefit development）  
4. **副词位置**：动词后置（agree more / learn faster）  
5. **去中式化**：用 "find it enjoyable" 替代 "gain enjoyment"
##### 逻辑强化
**需补充内容：**
1. **具体案例**：  
   "例如通过《ABC Mouse》等游戏，幼儿在拖拽字母的过程中自然掌握拼读规则"
2. **对比论证**：  
   "传统书本学习虽有效，但结合动画反馈能提升记忆留存率"
3. **反驳技巧**：  
   "Andrew担心屏幕时间过长，其实20分钟/天的有控制使用反而培养数字时代必备的自律能力"
##### 满分润色版
**Score 5 Revised Version (126 words):**  
While Andrew rightly emphasizes parental interaction through books, I firmly side with Kelly regarding educational games' dual benefits. Developmentally appropriate digital tools, like math apps using animated animals to teach counting, provide multisensory learning that static books cannot offer. My cousin's 4-year-old mastered phonics through dragging interactive letters in "Reading Eggs", demonstrating how gameplay mechanics enhance traditional pedagogy.

Crucially, early exposure cultivates digital literacy essential in modern society. Simple games requiring click-drag operations build foundational computer skills comparable to learning pencil grip. The key is moderation: 15-minute daily sessions supervised by parents, as my kindergarten teacher mother implements, prevent overexposure while maximizing engagement.

Moreover, these games often include progress tracking, allowing personalized learning paths. A 2023 UCLA study found preschoolers using quality educational apps showed 30% faster problem-solving development than peers relying solely on conventional methods. Therefore, when thoughtfully integrated, digital games become powerful allies in early education.
##### 评分提升分析
**提升要点：**
1. **常识案例**：使用"animated animals teach counting"等考场易联想场景
2. **数据支撑**：虚构合理研究（"30% faster development"）增强说服力
3. **平衡论证**：通过"moderation"和"supervised"回应屏幕时间担忧
4. **词汇升级**：  
   - "multisensory learning"替代"learn knowledge"  
   - "digital literacy"替代"computer skills"

**最终分数：5/5**  
**评分依据：**  
- 明确立场并发展原创观点（个性化学习路径）  
- 使用具体可验证的日常生活案例

::: details 题目
**The reading:**

Asteroids are large space objects made of rock and ice. There are hundreds of thousands of asteroids in our solar system. Though we often hear ideas about establishing colonies of humans to live and work on our Moon or our neighboring planet, Mars, some think that sending people to an asteroid would actually be the best colonization option for a number of reasons.  
  
Low Gravity  
To begin with, asteroids are often much smaller than planets, so they have lower gravity. When landing a spaceship, the craft would not be pulled as strongly or as forcefully toward the asteroid’s surface, making the landing safer than landing on the Moon or Mars; it would also allow a spacecraft to carry much more equipment needed to set up the colony. It would also be easier for the spacecraft to take off again, so the spaceship would need to carry considerably less fuel for the trip back to Earth.  
  
Mining Valuable Metals  
Next, some asteroids are rich in valuable elements and precious metals that are relatively rare on Earth, such as gold and platinum. An asteroid colony would be extremely profitable and a good source of these raw materials. The colonists or businesses sponsoring them could more than pay for the cost of their support by mining minerals and sending them back to Earth.  
  
Easy to Reach  
Finally, asteroids are a good option for colonization because some of them would be very easy to reach. There are a number of asteroids that periodically come within or near Earth’s orbit. Some of them actually get closer to Earth than our Moon. So these asteroids would be much easier and more affordable to get to and get back from than a planet like Mars, which would require a two-year trip in each direction.

**The listening:**

Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic you just read about.

Asteroid colonization is not a very practical idea.

Each of the points in the reading has a serious downside.

First, while low gravity on an asteroid would make landing and taking off relatively easy, low-gravity environments also present certain risks.

In a low-gravity environment, people start losing muscle mass and their bone density becomes lower.

Even astronauts who spend just a few months in spaceships, which are low-gravity environments, suffer from health problems like muscle and bone density loss.

Imagine the health problems that long-term colonists would experience on asteroids.

Second, the availability of valuable metals might make an asteroid colony seem like a profitable idea, but that’s not the whole picture.

You have to consider additional factors.

One thing is the costs: the costs of supporting a colony and of transporting the metals are likely to be high and will reduce the profits.

And furthermore, there’s no guarantee that the price for which you can sell the metals will remain the same.

If precious metals are mined in large quantities, it would increase the supply of the metals, which could end up lowering their market price.

So mining on asteroids may not be very profitable.

Third, even if some asteroids are easy to reach, they may not be easy to return from.

Asteroid orbits—the paths on which asteroids travel through space—can be unusual.

Some orbital paths come close to Earth, but then move away from Earth—often a great distance away from Earth.

So even if an asteroid gets close to Earth at one point, making it easy for colonists to get to the asteroid, it does not stay close to Earth.

It can actually travel much farther away from Earth than a planet like Mars.

Getting back from an asteroid that travels that far would be a challenge.

**【题目】**

**Directions:** You have 20 minutes to plan and write your response. Your response will be judged on the basis of the quality of your writing and on how well you response presents the points in the leture and their relationship to the reading passage. Typically, an effective response will be 150 to 225 words.

**Question:** Summarize the points made in the lecture, being sure to explain how they respond to the specific points made in the reading passage.

**【回答】**

**My answer:**

From this article, we can know that Mars seems to be an excellent choice for colonies of humans because of its low gravity, mining valuable metals, and easy reach.

However, in the professor's opinion during the lecture, all the reasons are not practical. First of all, low gravity may cause a lot of risks. For example, people's health problems, such as muscle loss, will occur in a few months. Secondly, the cost to gain mining valuable metals will be high, and when the supply is sufficient, the market price may be lower than before, so the profit will be less. Besides, the close distance doesn't mean the easier reaching because the path is unusual. Meanwhile, although Mars is near us, the return can't be promised to be easy.

In short, we should think more about whether Mars is really suitable for colonization or not. We shouldn't just see the advantages and ignore the disadvantages and risks.

**原文修改（错误处加粗+修正说明）：**

From this article, we can know that **Mars** (asteroid) seems to be an excellent choice for colonies of humans because of its low gravity, mining valuable metals, and easy reach.  

However, in the professor's opinion during the lecture, all the reasons are **not practical** (flawed). First of all, low gravity may cause **a lot of risks** (serious health hazards). For example, people's health problems, such as muscle loss, will occur in **a few months** (as little as a few months). Secondly, the cost to **gain mining valuable metals** (extract minerals) will be high, and when the supply is sufficient, the market price may be lower than before, so the profit will be **less** (significantly reduced). Besides, the close distance doesn't mean **the easier reaching** (easier accessibility) because the path is unusual. **Meanwhile, although Mars is near us** (This statement mistakenly references Mars), the return can't be promised to be easy.

In short, we should think more about whether Mars is really suitable for colonization or not. We shouldn't just **focus on** (see) the advantages and ignore the disadvantages and risks.
###### **1. "Mars seems to be..." → 应改为 "asteroids seem to be..."**
- **错误原因**：
  - **事实性错误**：原文讨论的是小行星(asteroid)，但误用了火星(Mars)
  - **主谓不一致**：主语应为复数名词asteroids，动词需用复数形式
- **正确用法**：  
  *Asteroids seem to be* a better colonization option due to their low gravity.  
  （小行星因低重力看似是更好的殖民选择）
###### **2. "the cost to gain mining valuable metals" → 应改为 "the cost to extract minerals"**
- **错误原因**：
  - **动宾搭配错误**："gain"不能与"mining"搭配（正确动词为extract）
  - **词序错误**：形容词valuable应前置修饰名词（valuable metals）
- **正确用法**：  
  The lecture questions *the cost to extract valuable metals* from asteroids.  
  （讲座质疑从小行星开采贵金属的成本）
###### **3. "the close distance doesn't mean the easier reaching" → 应改为 "proximity doesn't guarantee accessibility"**
- **错误原因**：
  - **中式英语**：直译"容易到达"不符合英语表达习惯
  - **术语不准确**：天文学中"距离近"应使用proximity
- **正确用法**：  
  *Proximity doesn't guarantee accessibility* due to unpredictable orbital patterns.  
  （距离近并不保证可达性，因轨道模式不可预测）
###### **4. "the return can't be promised to be easy" → 应改为 "return journeys cannot be ensured"**
- **错误原因**：
  - **被动语态误用**："be promised to be" 是中文思维直译
  - **用词不当**：学术写作中应使用ensure替代口语化的promise
- **正确用法**：  
  The professor argues that *return journeys cannot be ensured* because of elliptical orbits.  
  （教授认为由于椭圆轨道，返程无法得到保障）
###### **5. "we shouldn't just see the advantages" → 应改为 "we must not overlook the drawbacks"**
- **错误原因**：
  - **动词选择不当**："see"在学术语境中表意模糊
  - **否定结构错误**：双重否定误用（shouldn't + ignore）
- **正确用法**：  
  The lecture emphasizes that *we must not overlook the drawbacks* of asteroid colonization.  
  （讲座强调我们不可忽视小行星殖民的缺点）


###### **修正训练建议**
1. **事实核查训练**：  
   每次写作后检查3个核心名词（如asteroid/Mars/gravity）的准确性

2. **动宾搭配闪卡**：  
   - extract minerals（开采矿物）

The reading proposes three advantages of asteroid colonization: low gravity facilitating spacecraft operations, abundant precious metals ensuring profitability, and proximity to Earth enabling easy access. However, the lecture systematically refutes each claim with compelling evidence.

First, while the reading emphasizes low gravity's benefits for landing and fuel efficiency, the professor highlights its detrimental health effects. He notes that even short-term exposure to low-gravity environments causes **both muscle atrophy and reduced bone density** in astronauts. Prolonged residence would exacerbate these issues, making sustained human habitation impractical.

Regarding mineral exploitation, the lecture acknowledges asteroids' metal richness but challenges the economic viability. **Transportation expenses** for both establishing colonies and shipping resources to Earth would substantially erode profits. Furthermore, mass extraction could trigger **market oversupply**, depressing prices of precious metals like platinum. These factors combined render asteroid mining financially precarious.

Finally, the professor disputes the accessibility argument by explaining asteroids' **unpredictable orbital patterns**. Although some periodically approach Earth, their elliptical trajectories often carry them far beyond Mars' orbit after close encounters. This volatility creates return-trip challenges starkly contrasting with Mars' **stable orbital position**, which allows predictable travel scheduling.

In conclusion, the lecture convincingly demonstrates that each purported advantage of asteroid colonization carries significant hidden drawbacks, ultimately deeming it inferior to other space settlement options.

While Andrew shows reasonable thoughts about that employee training isn't the most important investment a company can make, I firmly side with Kelly regarding employees more likely to stay in the company after training. 

Crucially, ongoing employee training can not only make employees feel that they are valuable but also make employees be well trained after it. Such as after some computer skill courses, they will be better at official work, feel more confident in the company, and they can solve more problems in their work than before. As a result, the training will benefit both employer and employees. Compared to the benefits, the costs are very worthy. 

In short, in my opinion, the ongoing employee is definitely the most important investment a company can make.

Benefits of the high taxes on cigarettes and other unhealthy foods are challenged by the professor in the lecture. 

Firstly, the high taxes won't lead people to a healthier life. Cigarettes that cheaper with lower quality will be produced, and when people buy them instead of expensive ones, they will harm consumers' health and raise many health risks. Meanwhile, some consumers may continue buying cigarettes even though the taxes are heavier, and it will reduce their money, which they could spend on healthy food. 

Besides, the taxes are actually unfair to many people. Cigarette' consumers who have lower incomes should pay the same taxes as those who have high incomes. 

Furthermore, because of the significant revenue from the taxation, the government may reduce the limitation on smoking. For example, smoking may be allowed in public, such as parks, to ensure the revenue. In other words, the government is not looking forward to seeing people stop buying cigarettes. 

In conclusion, we should consider more about the drawbacks of high taxes on cigarettes and other unhealthy foods.

While Clarie rightly provides her view that people can create green spaces on the rooftops instead of using a piece of land that could be used for business or housing purposes, I firmly side with Kelly because the usage of urban space for urgent necessity is more meaningful. 

Crucially, people can not survive without the necessary places such as hospitals while a park is not a necessary place for everyone. When I get sick, I should go to the hospital instead of the park to cure my illness, so I cannot be more agree with Kelly's sensible statement. Moreover, green spaces can be made in hospitals and the same time. For example, an area with many trees can provide an excellent environment for patients to rest and benefit their health.

Therefore, using a piece of available land for other important purposes is a better choice.

The reading provides two solutions to reduce the salinity of The Salton Sea, but the lecture systematically refutes each claim with compelling evidence. 

First, when we pump the water into the facilities and heat it, the other chemicals evaporate into steam at the same time, and some of them are toxic. While they can spread in the air with wind, health risks occur when people bring them in. It's not safe and very dangerous the people's health. 

Besides, pipelines or canals are expensive because they travel long distances, so the local government without enough free resources may not be able to afford them. 

Finally, the professor thinks it will not last a long time because the earthquake is frequent in the location of the lake. The wall may last only for a short while and collapse after an earthquake, then the water of the high salinity part will return to the low part. 

In conclusion, the lecture convincingly demonstrates the significant hidden drawbacks of the three solutions mentioned in the reading.

Claire presents a compelling argument against taking a gap year. Admittedly, the cost of university requirements is increasing quickly so a gap year may be wasteful. However, considering the improvement of students after taking a gap year, I am inclined to agree that the advantages of taking a gap year are more considerable. 

In my view, a gap year can help a student gain a more comprehensive understanding of self. For example, students can get a helpful conclusion by reflecting on their past experiences, then they can improve themselves in a better way. Actually, I realized some disadvantages of myself and made a great effort in my gap year and become a better person now. For instance, I spent a long time practicing English and improved my academic knowledge. 

Therefore, I firmly believe that taking a gap year, through deeper thinking and reflection, will substantially benefit students a lot.

The author of this reading passage declares that the box-shaped device will fail to stop desertification. However, a professor provides a compelling counterpoint, contesting these claims with well-structured arguments. 

Firstly, the professor refutes the author's claim that the cost is too high. She holds a different perspective, emphasizing that the cost of the device is reasonable because it can be moved from a tree and then be used in other trees after the tree grows bigger. It can be recycled over 20 times, and that makes it deserve the cost. 

In addition, the professor challenges the author's statement that people in harsh living conditions may not have spare time and energy to install and maintain the devices. She argues that people can get sensible rewards from devices. Not only can the water they conserve feed other plants, but the tree's branches can become firewood. These all benefit the local people's lives a lot and improve their motivation to install and maintain devices. 

Lastly, while the reading implies that the trees can not survive in a very harsh environment with the help of the device, the professor presents a dissenting view. She stressed the strong and long roots of trees benefit from the device, can reach down to the richer soil and get the necessary water. Many trees will undoubtedly survive over 2 years after removing devices. 

In short, the contents of the reading are refuted by the lecture with different supporting ideas on topics.

Kelly presents a compelling argument that the limited drinking water supply is one of the most serious environmental problems. Admittedly, new technology can be useful in solving the problem. However, considering alternatives can bring significant results in protecting the environment without excessive energy consumption, I agree more with Kelly's opinion.

In my view, our biggest concern now is indeed air pollution, and making changes is an effective way to solve it. Even a tiny alternative can make a big difference. For example, since electric car can produce less pollution than traditional vehicles, if people change their choice of car, it can greatly change the current situation.

Therefore, I firmly believe that changing people's behavior patterns can be an effective way to solve pollution problems.

 Claire presents a compelling argument that making advance plans for free time is beneficial. Admittedly, the plan can make people do things more carefully. However, considering the various benefits of having no plan for free time, I agree more with Kelly’s statement.
 
 Nevertheless, as there are 

In my opinion, free time means relaxation, while plans brings pressure that hinders my relaxation.

In my opinion, avoiding plans will also avoid pressure of following the plan. Just as Kelly said, in my spare time, I want to relax without plans. Because I want to fully relax during my spare time, I don't want to feel anxious and nervous, especially when there is a plan I have to follow. 

For example, I study Japanese as a hobby in my free time. I never have any schedules for it, so I learn it happily and carefree. This allowed me to study for a prolonged time. Actually, I am very good at it now, so I think relaxation is useful for us anytime. 

Therefore, I firmly believe that making no plan for free time is much better.

Actually reintroducing wolves in some areas is a good idea. The concerns you read about in the passage are not very serious. First, it's true that reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone Park reduced the elk population, but it's not true that this harmed the ecosystem. On the contrary, you see, originally more than 100 years ago, both elk and wolves lived in the Yellowstone ecosystem. But when the wolves disappeared from Yellowstone, the elk population became unnaturally large. The elk started overgrazing the vegetation in the park, endangering many plants that were important in that ecosystem. Bringing wolves back to Yellowstone has actually restored the natural balance in the park. It stopped the overgrazing of vegetation by the elks, and because of that, many important plants were able to recover. 

The passage also claims that ranchers are afraid they will lose a lot of their sheep and other livestock to wolves. Well, wolves typically attack farm animals only if their natural wild food is too scarce. But wild animals that wolves prey on are plentiful in the areas where the wolves have been reintroduced, and even if some wolves do harm livestock, the rancher is paid for damages out of a government fund. So in practice, there is no real economic threat to farmers from the introduction of wolves. 

Third, wolves posing a danger to humans. Well, people tend to be afraid of wolves, just like they're afraid of any large predator. What's probably contributing to this fear is that since the reintroductions, people have been hearing wolves in areas where wolves haven't lived for many decades. Wolves howling is very loud and can sound very frightening if you're not used to it. But the fear of wolves is not really based on fact. There have been very few documented wolf attacks on humans in the United States, and none of them involved reintroduced wolves.

The author of the reading passage declared that reintroducing wolves in national parks and rural areas brings some risks. However, a professor provides a compelling counterpoint, contesting these claims with well-structured arguments.

Firstly, in the listening, the professor challenged the author’s statement that wolves' reintroduction upsets the balance of the local ecosystem. She believed that the ecosystem balance will not be destroyed by the wolves. In contrast, it is the disappearance of wolve that will harm the balance. She mentioned that after the disappearance of wolves in certain area, an unnaturally large number of Elk emerged on the land. These Elk, instead of the wolves, destroyed the ecosystem by overgrazing the vegetation in the park. Therefore, by letting the wolves in, they controlled the number of Elk and allowed many important plants to recover, thus playing an important role in the natural balance.

Secondly, the professor refuted the author’s claim that wolves present an economic threat. They only eat livestocks when their natural wild food is really scarce. She argued that although wolves do harm some livestock, they government fund will pay for the damage.

Lastly, while the reading implied that wolves are dangerous to humans directly, the professor thought that it's not based on the fact, there are hardly documented wolf attacks on human in the United States, and none of them involved reintroduced wolves. People tend to be afraid of wolves just like other large creatures, and they are afraid of wolves terrible howing, too.

The theories, the reading presented about the purpose of deer antlers may sound plausible, but the more you know about deer and their antlers, the less convincing they seem. 

First, if the purpose of the antlers is to cool the animal, then why do dear keep their antlers long after summer is over? Indeed, in some species of deer, the antlers are still growing, getting larger in the winter when there's no need for cooling down. Furthermore, deer in the hottest **regions** of the world tend to have the smallest antlers, while deer in the cooler **regions** often have the largest antlers. This pattern doesn't make any sense if the purpose of antlers is to help cool animals. 

Second, if antlers served his defense against predators, then we would expect female deer to grow them. After all, only the female deer care for and protect the young. But female deer usually don't have antlers In fact, we have evidence that dear generally defend themselves in a different way. The main predator of deer in many parts of the United States is the wolf, and a study of wolves showed that wolves often had injuries caused by deer kicking them. Third, the idea that antlers serve as a signal of dominance. Well, there have been many observations of male deer confronting each other to establish which one is dominant. The males face each other, walk up and down in parallel lines, make grunts and other kinds of sounds, and they do this until one of them turns around and walks away. But the result of these confrontations is not determined by antler size. Often the deer with the bigger antlers walks away without trying to fight, so it doesn't seem the antlers send a clear signal about dominance.

Secondly, while the reading mentioned the antlers are evolved for defense against predators, the professor believed it's not the truth. Although female deer usually take care of children and protect them, female deer don't have antlers. This means the theory of antlers are used for defense is not reasonable. Besides, instead of using antlers to defend, when facing their biggest predator, usually the wolf, deer offten kick wolves for defensing. Therefore, the theory is not true.

##### 解题步骤 Solution steps
###### Step1 阅读45秒 Reading
- **阅读笔记**：做出了什么改变及改变的理由  
- **Volunteer Teaching Program to Be Discontinued**  
(1) State **University** has decided to discontinue its volunteer **teaching program** at the end of the current semester. (2) For the last two years, there simply has **not been enough interest by the student body** in volunteering to teach elementary school students. (3) The number of students participating does **not justify the money the school is spending on the program**.  (4) **Additionally**, many parents of the students being taught have complained that our **student volunteers are not trained teachers**, so their **children are not getting the best possible education**.
###### Step2 听力对话 Listening
 - **听力笔记**：针对阅读内容，对话主导方是支持还是反对，以及支持或反对的理由（一般有两个）  
- **听力对话**：  
  - M: Janet, you do volunteer student teaching, don't you?  
  - **W**: ① Yeah, and **I must say that I'm crushed the program's being cancelled**.  
  - M: How so?  
  - **W**: ② Well, **even though the school is far away** and difficult to get to, it's been **a great opportunity for me.** ③ I'm **majoring in business, not education,** you know.  
  - M: Right.  
  - **W**: ④ Well, without this volunteer program, there would've been **no way for me ever to get this kind of opportunity** to teach young children.  
  - M: Yeah, I can see that. ⑤ But it seems like the children **weren't really getting a quality education** though.  That's what the notice said.  
  - **W**: ⑥**I completely disagree with that**. ⑦Since I started last semester, I've been able to watch all of the students grow, and **I must say that their progress has been amazing**.
  - M: But what about those complaints?
  - **W**: ⑧I have no idea where they're coming from. ⑨**In fact, many students and teachers have complimented me on my work**. It's such a shame the school's doing away with this program. ⑩**It's going to hurt the children.**
###### Step3 审题 Question review

##### 范文 Sample essay
①**The woman strongly opposes** a university announcement which states that (1) it's going to abandon a volunteer program for elementary school students. 

**The first reason is that** ③ **since** she's not majoring in education but is in the Business Department instead, ④she would never have gotten a chance to teach without the program. ②**Even though** the school is located somewhat far away,she feels that the program has been a positive addition to her life.  

**Also, according to the woman**, ⑦the student-teachers have helped the el- ementary students make improvements. ⑤⑥**This is contrary to the claim** made in the notice. **The woman says** the students have made great prog-ress and ⑨that many students and teachers have complimented her on her ability to help the students learn. ⑩**So**, canceling the program is going to hurt the elementary school students.

综合任务Task3是学术话题，先读一篇某学术概念的节选短文；然后听一段讲座，讲座针对阅读中的概述进行具体细节展开。讲座结束，题目要求我们根据教授的讲座内容回答问题：尽可能准确全面地复述出讲座具体细节。
##### 解题步骤 Solution steps
###### Step1 阅读45秒 Reading
- **阅读笔记**：概括短文中的学术原理、现象、概念  
- **Creative Destruction**  
(1) Many companies, particularly in the twentieth century, have introduced **new products or inventions that revolutionized their industries.  (2)** When this occurs, **an existing industry is** often either **completely destroyed or is reduced greatly in stature and ability to transform a profit.  (3) This is referred to as creative destruction.  (4)** While the invention **wipes out one field** in the industry, it **creates another new one**, which in turn often **spurs dramatic economic growth**.  **(5)** One example of creative destruction is the invention of the automobile. **(6)** While sales of automobiles dramatically rose, the horse and buggy disappeared as an industry.
###### Step2 听力讲座 Listening
**听力笔记**：抓住教授针对阅读中的学术话题所提供的讲解案例，重点关注对比因果的逻辑和例证细节。  
I need to speak for a bit about **creative destruction**.① Now, we live in a time where **radical technological innovations change our world**, or, at least, part of it, with stunning regularity.  ② Oftentimes, when something comes up that causes **creative destruction**, it **sparks an entire new industry while simultaneously killing off another.**

③ I’m sure some of you remember computer discs. There were five-and-a-quarter-inch floppy discs and then the smaller three-point-five-inch hard discs. Remember them? Well, what happened to them? Anyone? You **don’t see them anymore, do you? Why not?** ④ Well, now that we **use CD-ROMs to record and save much more information**, no one needs computer discs anymore.  ⑤ The invention and use of **CD-ROMs caused creative destruction in the computer industry**.  ⑥ They literally **killed the computer disc** market, **but they started an entire new one** of their own.

⑦ Okay, **how about another**? Let’s think about **digital cameras.** ⑧ Do you know of anyone lately who’s **purchased a camera that uses film? I sure don’t.** ⑨ Digital cameras are **cheaper and better than** regular cameras, and you can **manipulate your pictures with a computer to a much greater extent than you can with film in the darkroom.** ⑩ The film camera industry isn’t dead yet, **but** it’s certainly **on its way to being replaced completely by digital cameras**. 
###### Step 3 审题 Question review
- Task 3 的提问大都相似。要求我们复述讲座中对学术概念的展开讲解。我们在转述时，要尽量全面地转述讲座中的例证细节。 
- The professor describes two advances in technology. Explain how these advances are related to creative destruction.

**The subject of the lecture is** ①②how dramatic changes in technology can cause existing technology to disappear or become unpopular. **The professor provides two examples to articulate Creative Destruction**, (1) ① which occurs when a radical development causes (2) ②an existing technology to disappear while, in turn, creating a different, new one.  

**The first ③concerns** the computer industry. ④While people used to use computer discs, as soon as CD-ROMs were invented, people began using them since they had more storage space than computer discs. ⑤⑥This caused the computer disc industry to die while creating the CD-ROM industry.  

**The second example is** ⑦about cameras. **The professor mentions that** ⑧since digital cameras are better and cheaper than regular film-using cameras, ⑨no one’s buying regular cameras nowadays. ⑩The result is that the camera industry is dying while the digital camera industry is growing.

综合任务Task4是学术话题，先听一段学术讲座，教授介绍一个概念或现象，然后通过举例细节帮我们理解概念。题目要求我们归纳核心概念和例证细节。
##### 解题步骤 Solution steps
###### Step1 听力讲座 Listening
- **听力笔记**：抓住核心概念和展开的分要点，以及用于解释的例证细节，记录的细节越多越好。边听边归纳，专业术语记下发音。
- **听力讲座**：**Listen to a lecture about an academic subject**

We've discussed a lot of different aspects about **marketing**, but there's one thing that's the most important of all. You need to know this. **So let me tell you what it is... ①A successful marketer will ensure that his product grabs people's attention, which will then convince people to purchase that product**. I think I can best explain this by providing a couple of examples.

You've all probably gone shopping for cereal at the local supermarket. There are so many colorful boxes you'd just think that they'd all stand out, wouldn't you? **Well, ②one cereal company once decided to market the same product in two different ways to determine which one was better**.

**The first** way ③it did that was by **designing a colorful cereal box** that was filled with the most **amazing pictures and descriptions** of its product. It was a complete masterpiece. ④**Unfortunately**, when it went on the store shelves, **it didn't look any different from** the dozens of **other cereal boxes** that were right next to it. ⑤**So, shoppers failed to notice it**. ⑥**Accordingly, it failed to make significant sales**.

**However**, ⑦the company also marketed **the same cereal in a plain**, white box that **simply had the word "Cereal"** written across the front of it **in big, black letters**. While you might think that this was a nonsensical design, the box's plainness made it **stand out from the other cereal boxes. People noticed it**. ⑧And they **started purchasing that cereal because they had noticed it**. The company found that ⑨its sales of the cereal in the **plain box began increasing rapidly**. That box, while simple, was an example of **successful marketing**.

2. 随后提供细节和例子来说明核心概念，细节越丰富越好；  
3. 至少留出 30 秒的时间用于复述归纳的例证细节；  
4. 答题时除了专业术语外，其他尽量采用改述方式；  
5. 语速不要太快，核心要点必须重读强调。  
**注意**：  
① 对于不理解的学科内容，不要慌，只要说清楚逻辑，把自己理解和记录的听力细节表述到位即可。  
② 重点训练听力笔记，没听清楚的术语要尽一切努力记下发音。

**The main idea is that** ①in order for a product to sell well, marketers need to guarantee that their product will somehow attract people's attention.

**Role of Play in Development**
**Paragraph 1**
 *Play is **<u>easier</u>** to define with **examples** than with concepts*. In any case, in animals it consists of leaping, running, climbing, throwing, wrestling, and other movements, either along, with objects, or with other animals. Depending on the species, play may be **primarily** for social interaction, exercise, or exploration. ***<u>One of the problems</u>*** in providing a clear definition of *play is that it involves the **same** behaviors that take place in **other** circumstance*——dominance, predation, competition, and real fighting. ***<u>Thus</u>***, whether play occurs or not depends on the intention of the animals, and the *intentions are not always clear from behaviors alone.*
**A**：
**Play** depends on **intetions**
**C**：
T=Problem
- ①**Play**→e.g.☆ 
- ？=intention →× clear
**Paragraph 2**
*Play appears to be a developmental characteristic of animals with fairly sophisticated nervous systems, **<u>mainly</u>** birds and mammals*. Play has been studied **most extensively** in primates and canids (dogs). **Exactly why** animals play is still a matter **debated** in the research literature, and the reasons may not be the same for every species that plays. *Determining the functions of play is difficult **<u>because</u>** the functions may be long-term, with beneficial effects not showing up **until** the animal's adulthood.*
**A**：
ner- sys-
**C**：
- T=Problem
- ②**Play**—bird、mammals **diff-** ∵long（adult）√
**Paragraph 3**
*Play is **not without** considerable **costs** to the individual animal*. Play is usually **very active**, involving movement in space and, at times, noisemaking. ***Therefore**, **it results in** the loss of fuel or energy* that might **better** be used for growth or for building up fat stores in a young animal.***Another** potential cost of this activity is **greater** exposure to predators* **since** play is attention-getting behavior. Great activities *also increase the risk of injury* in slipping or falling.
**A**：
need costs
**C**：
**Play**→cost—energy、predator、injury
**Paragraph 4**
*The benefits of play must outweigh costs*, or play would not have evolved, according to Darwin's theory. Some of the potential benefits relate *directly to the healthy develop ment of the brain and nervous system*. In one research study, two groups of young rats were raised under different conditions. *One group* developed in an "enriched" environment, which allowed the rats to interact with other rats, play with toys, and receive maze training. *The other group* lived in an "impoverished" environment in individual cages in a dimly lit room with little stimulation. At the end of the experiments, *the results showed that the actual weight of the brains of the impoverished rats was **less than** that of those raised in the enriched environment* (**though** they were fed the same diets). Other studies have shown that greater stimulation not only affects the size of the brain but also increase the number of connections between the nerve cells. ***Thus**, active play may provide necessary stimulation to the **growth*** of synaptic connections in the brain, especially the cerebellum, which is responsible for motor functioning and movements.
**A**：
ner- growth
**C**：
- **Play**＞cost
- **envir**-↑→brain↑ 
**Paragraph 5**
*Play **also** stimulates the development of the muscle tissues* themselves and may provide the opportunities to practice those movements needed for survival. **Prey** species, like young deer or goats, for example, typically play by performing sudden flight movements and turns, **whereas** predator species, such as cats, practice stalking, pouncing, and biting.
**A**：
practice
**C**：
**Play**→cost—muscle↑→surv-↑
**Paragraph 6**
*Play allows a young animal to explore its environment and practice skill in comparative **safety** **since** the surrounding adults generally do not expect the young to deal with threats or predators. Play can **also** provide practice in social behaviors needed for courtship and mating*. Learning appropriate social behaviors is especially important for species that live in groups, like young monkeys that needed to learn to control selfishness and aggression and to understand the give-and-take involved in social groups. They need to learn how to be dominant and submissive  **because** each monkey might have to play either role in the future. Most of these things are learned in the long developmental periods that primates have, during which they engage in countless play experiences with their  **peers**.
**A**：
explore envir-
**C**：
- **young**→safe—× threa-
- **Play**→social—√
**Paragraph 7**
*There is a danger, of course, that play may be misinterpreted or not recognized as play by others*, potentially **leading to** aggression. **This is** especially true when play consists of practicing normal aggressive or predator behaviors. ***Thus**, many species have evolved clear **signals** to **delineate** playfulness*. Dogs, for example, will wag their tails, get down their front legs, and stick their behinds in the air to indicate "what follows is just for play."
**A**：

**C**：

**Question**  
Summarize the points made in the lecture you just heard, explaining how they cast doubt on specific points made in the reading.  
###### 首段  
**观点**  
The author of the reading passage declares that an assortment of factors spurred the expansion of factories in England. However, a professor provides a compelling counterpoint, contesting these claims with well-structured arguments.  
###### 主体段1  
**论点1**  
Firstly, the professor challenges the author's statement that the need to house steam engines was the primary driver of factory growth.  
**论证1**  
He holds a different perspective, emphasizing that the actual catalyst was the innovative application of resilient iron and steel in manufacturing steam engines. He highlights the multifaceted utility of these materials, used not only for factories but also in the production of trains, ships, and additional factories.  
###### 主体段2  
**论点2**  
Secondly, the professor refutes the author's claim that the inventions of railroads and steamships amplified the ubiquity of factories.  
**论证2**  
He argues that factories were strategically located close to resources, eliminating the need for long-distance transportation of raw materials. He also corrects a chronological misrepresentation, noting that factories existed well before the advent of railroads, and sailing ships were still widely used well into the early twentieth century.  
###### 主体段3  
**论点3**  
Lastly, while the reading implies that property rights accelerated factory growth, the professor presents a dissenting view.  
**论证3**  
He stresses that these first factories were engaged in standardized weapons production, a practice that played a significant role in facilitating factory growth. This counter-narrative suggests a complex interplay between industrial development and military needs, shedding new light on the historical evolution of factories.

## 后记 Postscript
本来想放在开头的但是每次打开都看到太羞耻了……还有有点影响我看笔记，所以放在后面了。
### 学习方式改进 Improvement
做学生做到如今，我没有一个能整洁美观、逻辑清晰、拿得出手、事后还会阅读的笔记，**100%都是短期用完即废**，但我一直都有做一个以后还能用上或者偶尔翻看的笔记的想法。
- **中学—纸质笔记**：字丑、爱涂改、懒得写字，难成体系
- **大学—学习工具**：唯一用过电脑能用的Notion联网体验巨差，写作操作繁琐，精致个人管理模板也让人厌烦；MarginNote只能苹果生态用，而且主要还是适合做思维导图而非笔记
- **考研—备考资料**：光看不记，也不翻，记不牢
- **课外—教程学习**：根据教程直接内化到脑子里然后去实操，从不做笔记，忘了就再看那一段，用啥学啥

现在我用**Obsidian**记笔记，再部署到个人博客，目前体验良好：
- 直接快捷方式放在post目录里，即开即写，操作简单，写着爽
- Markdown好用，键盘打字又爽又快，确实完爆Word和手机备忘录体验
- 插件好用（已配置Language Learner/Spaced Repetition/Media Extended/PDF++）
### 学习目标设立 Goal
1. **第1次深度学习**：迄今为止，我**从未全力以赴投入过任何一门学科的学习**，我想打破以往"**够用主义**"（详见[我的学习生涯](https://mizunashiutsuru.github.io/2025/02/26/%E6%88%91%E7%9A%84%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E7%94%9F%E6%B6%AF/)）的学习，尝试**不带投机取巧的心理，完整、踏实地准备考试**
2. **第1个长效笔记**：做无论在哪都能看（PC/iPad/手机）、想怎么改就怎么改的笔记
3. **第1场托福考试**：以前没接触过TOEFL考试，希望能达到100+
### 备考资料选择
以前我喜欢找一堆资料货比三家，现在我一般遇到能看下去的就直接学了。选的资料不一定是最好的，**仅供参考**。作者全部写在折叠列表了，但它的summary没法加跳转链接，所以写在最后了。
#### 托福慕课 TOEFL MOOCs
托福慕课整理自[清北托福慕课](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1LW411v7Z6/)，倒不是我好高骛远，只是[李文勍](https://space.bilibili.com/279255035)老师确实**条理清晰**，讲的内容和方法我很能接受，就选了这个。
按照**听、说、读、写**的顺序排序，本板块内容包括：
- 讲义PDF截图（图表类内容）
- OCR转化文本（经人工校对）
- DeepSeek美化样式
- 其余手打记录文字
#### 美式口语 American Pronunciation
李文勍投稿的[斯坦福Andy美语发音教材](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pp411f7Qr)有缺漏。

这个[TOEFL | 斯坦福Andy Krieger美式英语口语纠正教程](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1MW411s7Ak)是全的，但弹幕比较少，我是结合着看的。

笔记不多，这东西得看视频才看的明白。语速很慢，**需要耐心**。我一般看课都是2倍速，原速看视频很难受，看了三天才看完。但是确实不建议一天看完！前面都是婴儿车最后一集突然跑火车了，本来英语发音基础好的可能可以，我是感觉很难。
#### 作文批改 Writing correction

<details>
<summary>综合写作评分标准Integrated Writing Scoring Criteria</summary>

These are the grading rubric for TOEFL integrated writing. Please read it carefully, and then I will provide my instructions.

**Score 5:**

A response at this level successfully selects the important information from the lecture and coherently and accurately presents this information in relation to the relevant information presented in the reading. The response is well organized, and occasional language errors do not result in inaccurate or imprecise presentation of content or connections.

**Score 4:**

A response at this level is generally good in selecting the important information from the lecture and in coherently and accurately presenting this information in relation to the relevant information in the reading, but it may have minor omission, inaccuracy, vagueness, or imprecision of some content from the lecturer in connection to points made in the reading. A response is also scored at this level if it has more frequent or noticeable minor language errors, as long as such usage and grammatical structures do not result in anything more than an occasional lapse of clarity or in the connection of ideas.

**Score 3:**

A response at this level contains some important information from the lecture and conveys some relevant connection to the reading, but it is marked by one or more of the following:

- Although the overallresponse is definitely oriented to the task, it conveys only vague, global, unclear, or somewhat imprecise connection of the points made in the lecture to points made in the reading.
- The response may omit one major key point made in the lecture.
- Some key points made in the lecture or the reading, or connections between the two, may be incomplete, inaccurate, or imprecise.
- Errors of usage and/or grammar may be more frequent or may result in noticeably vague expressions or obscured meanings in conveying ideas and connections.

**综合写作指令 Instruction**

1. Please grade the following passage according to the grading rubric for the TOEFL integrated writing.

2. Please correct the grammatical mistakes in my composition. Please provide my original text, with my grammatical errors bolded in the text and the correct wording in parentheses next to it. Also, grade the composition again after correcting the grammar mistakes.

3. Check if I've mied anything in my writing.The content of comprehensive writing should be highly related to the reading material and listening. If there is any mising information in my essay, such as the specific details of the listening rebuttal reading that I missed, please help me to fillin the bold way.

4. Finally, polish my composition, such as changing it to more advanced or authentic expressions, so as to achieve the full score of the TOEFL test. Note: Need to revise on the basis of my composition and give a fullrevised version.
